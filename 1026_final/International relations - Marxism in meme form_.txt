 so marxian Theory I I mean okay listen the the the marxists love to fight each other more than they love to fight any perceived enemy so I I take it as as given that there's lots of different um ways in which we can do this um it is less influential in certain ways compared to realism and liberalism so one of those experiences um that was talked about in the last video in the context of olympism was that the appeasement of the Nazis in the interwar period is what immediately led the realists to and including some of the the intellectual Jews who fled Europe to the U.S to argue that we have to be in terms of self-help and we have to be realistic so consequently the Americans are very realist um and liberal at the same time the rest of the world tends to be more liberal and some form of either marxists so there's a British tradition there's um all sorts of collective security schools in Europe and all the rest of that some form of not just liberalism or realism so this is very we want to stay abstract but they reflect the ideas they reflect the additives and opinions of those that have them so less influential in the U.S 100 the rest of the world less so uh depends where it honestly depends where um there are four there are different perspectives within this but fourth key themes uh reality as a totality I don't know I mean I don't know Marxist that wouldn't say that that's stupid and crass material is a bit object to it but whatever okay so the idea here is that um we have to conceptualize everything as a whole right um we have to we have to think about systems as coercion and consent as governed governing and govern that there is contestation inherent to the system you could call it class struggle you can call it struggle over social reproduction you can call it um whatever framework you want dependency whatever the idea here is that there are relations and processes um transmission belts of ideas that go back and forth between society and Elites Elites in society it has a materialist conception of History so it's more concerned with like how things happen and that it also frames itself in terms of emancipatory political project we need to fix these problems um and so uh I don't know who this capitalist totality is we did that stuff in the 70s maybe Andre Gunda Frank used to be at UT but he died in the 90s I don't know who this is and if you don't name names I don't trust you um as I've said throughout this course so Global political economy so the gpe I pulled that from our our um our uh chapters going forward because that chapter is so dry I I just don't think it would be useful for any of us um I wonder this is one of those the sleight of hand tricks that I've talked about throughout in the textbook when you don't really know what you want to do or you don't want to platform it or be accused of platforming it I guess you just make it sound really boring right the core accumulates profit by exploiting the periphery I mean okay David Harvey is argued against this for ages and ages it's just simply not true since 2000 like with Empire heart negri's Empire no one has asserted this but whatever we'll we'll say this International struggle is the relation between unequal social force is great I mean what isn't the goal is empowerment emancipation a global working class is there still a global working pass the end of exploitation through Revolution I'm sure uh challenges the status quo dominance interest and influential theories of fire this is such a crappy summary I just couldn't let it stand um so I'm going to do a pop culture reading of of Marxism Marxism is successful and popular and persists uh not because it is true but because the experiences of people are reflected in the ways that we think about things I could literally teach Marxism with memes it's not that hard I'll do it right now so this idea of like reducing these really abstract concepts with no specifics I think does a disservice to both our thinking about these things and our understanding just generally right here's an example billionaires we can talk about billionaires it's materialist it's about a holistic system the billionaires they have to get their money from somewhere everybody else has contributed systems they're creating and it it speaks to massive inequality and maybe forms of exploitation so why not use a simple example here this comes a friend of mine actually the best man at my wedding um uh wrote a book on Pluto the plutocracy and this one percent um and he just was doing numbers analysis because this is the materialist part like the these types of marxists love to look at the data like we're just data driven not Theory driven I said we there I like political economy I wouldn't identify as this type of although you know I can treat any perspective with a A Bit of Sympathy I'm being said this is sympathetic reading right so um because the textbook is doing such a non-sympathetic reading I'm going to do a sympathetic reading uh I don't have to agree with it but these are just interesting Concepts so the world's dead and this is uh Citibank this is city city group one of the major banks in the U.S in 2005 produced a report they've been doing this for a while they have ultra high net worth individuals books about this written I'll reference in a minute the world is divided into two blocks now the plutonomy where the economic growth is powered consumed by a wealthy few and then there's everybody else so there's no such thing as a u us consumer UK consumer Russian consumer anymore there are rich consumers few in number but just proportionate huge amounts of income and wealth these billionaires who can spend on whatever they can buy things um on a whim and sell them and Destroy them whatever they want right they can go to space they can go to submarines they could go wherever they want and then there's everybody else the non-rich the many accounting for small bites of national pie this is a bank saying this this isn't me okay so let's meme this  up um sorry for the swear um so stuff like this like we don't need a big analytical Theory to explain the idea of like forcing people to take unpaid leave during the pandemic so I could afford to fly myself to space is not great um the idea that someone who's got a Maserati and a yacht who represents the global one percent by a large Mark a margin is against things like child tax credit maternity leave child care and 35 insulin you could see how that could be rile people up um the fact that um that you can cancel as the uh Trump tax cuts did uh taxes for 1.7 trillion for 600 billionaires but not 1.7 trillion in student loan debt for 45 million Americans um seems to be unequal um if we did this in a basic level if somebody hoarded more and more of something well other people didn't have it we would want to find out what was wrong with it but instead we have Forbes um we have mechanisms uh corporations that are legal entities fictions that allow um businesses to create one that to Shell itself out I thought this was made up but I checked it out and no it's legit I was like am I just proper getting misinformation nope it's a little more nuanced than that they can't totally get out of their liability but they they have to some extent limited their liability again that's a limited Corporation not only that like we can expose all the time that we have all of the elites uh not paying their taxes globally um they use some type of offshore accounts to us to avoid taxes because they're sleazy whatever um nobody cares right so how is it that nobody cares about that or even if they care they can't do anything about it um and so we get instead these kind of these constant BR these PR bombardment about how important it is for us to know about the lives of these people rather than to care about things that happen so it becomes this it becomes a form of Sport the U.S is now obsessed with who's the richest person in the world and where'd they get their money well if you look at who the richest people are a lot of them got their money from uh Tech or things related to Tech in large part because they can minimize their taxes through a whole bunch of mechanisms but primarily by making sure that their income is as nil and that they own things in uh Capital values that the price of their stocks so they don't actually count as they've got this wealth but they don't have the income that that we can tax or they figure out ways to put it offshore and so here who are the richest Millennials who are the richest women and and the richest women are in these sectors right all of these different sectors many of them just of the Walton the Walton family the Walmarts um they do this so this is just a friend of mine he did this one percent the rest of us this is a political economy of dominant ownership and the 400 richest Americans have seen their effective tax rate cut by more than half since 1962. remember the marginal tax rate at the end of World War II for the top percent was 92 percent it is nowhere near that and anymore and so the bottom half during that same period who earned 18 500 a year saw their tax burden increase from 22 percent to 22.5 to 24 so this is the type of stuff that that yes it sounds like class Warfare if you've got a holistic system which is who's paying what for how much and you say the people at the top should pay less and less and the people at the bottom should pay more and more that's what we would call a regressive taxation system it's taking from the bulk to give to the few a progressive taxation system gives from the few and distributes to everybody we talked about this before in the context of Robin Hood right anyways so what this does though it's not just that it's also the transformation of the idea that everybody is invested in what happens with these billionaires right my Amazon Prime package comes quick because Jeff Bezos was able to innovate this and during the pandemic he made billions of billions of dollars well I had to sit home because I couldn't do the things that I traditionally would do and we relied on Amazon Prime so I'm not saying Amazon Prime is bad but as a system it reproduces and reinforces the wealth of these people at the top and so this idea of us now in being invested in what corporations do and what billionaires do is now like they are the leaders on politics and this thought thing these these thought issues and the black lives matter and in June you know they all had Pride flags up and so if we're actually looking at the analysis of this the history of meritocracy if we want to explain how it happens it's often because of these things it's that they make one kind of big innovation or one decision or Discovery and then they realize oh because of that if we want to maintain this and make sure we've got more we now have to in the case of Facebook have more um uh political lobbyists in Washington than there are members of the state department because they have to use that position of their early Advantage whatever they did they had one Innovation and then use that information to to create and maintain their wealth and so the idea of having strategic people from positions of power in the state military or in the corporations go back and forth in a kind of circular manner means that they're going to have more and more interest over or government policy making in society and then once they've accumulated those advantages they'll use that to make sure that they have more rest Prestige Wealth power and that we won't criticize them more and more famously New York Times a couple years ago said we can't do investigative reports anymore of the type of uh internal whistleblowing that happens within corporations or the bad things that corporations do because they can sue us out of existence we will only focus on the bad things that happen in the state um and so that that's a an interesting admission because they don't have the money they honestly don't they don't have the money to fight in court a a 1.5 trillion dollar company but they can fight a government because the government is a slow-moving thing and it has um obligations of of uh public information and providing um public access to documents and things like that so it's easier to do that so you understand and so this idea then is that what was public or should have been public has been and it continues to be maintained by um a powerful oligarchy that advances a particular interest this is that stuff we talked about before with oligarchy Stigler stiglitz he's a kind of Lefty uh Economist um calls this the US government is is one of the one percent by the one percent and for the one percent and so just some of the absurdities that come out of this for example like you know a U.S of income of 250 000 a year puts you in the 0.04 of the World Elite it's such a small number but we hear so much from those people globally um things like Forbes Magazine Saudi Prince suit Forge magazine because they under reported as well as 20 billion rather than 29.6 billion this idea that it's a a Perpetual competition like somehow hoarding resources is is a thing that we should value right this is the Marxist criticism and this is always what both male and marks argued is that possession of things is not the same as the capacity to buy things and so if you have an effective flat minimum wage since the mid 70s you're going to see the ways in which it's not just how much income you have it's if that income can help you buy things so I am in my 40s and I still rent because I didn't get into for many decisions I didn't get in the market and so now I'm stuck in the situation where I'm constantly paying my landlord's mortgage right and so that idea then of of producing things like unaffordable housing unaffordable education unaffordable Health Care um and as I've talked about before that bottom 20 the US has negative income because they're in debt and so you have this group at the top that's making more and more on the bottom is actually negative um and this isn't party based on my Facebook profile picture is um the clintons and the trumps hand-in-hand at one of the the events they were at right back that it doesn't mean anything it's just the argument here is that you know the idea that they fight each other in terms of politics but then get together socially is is a kind of class analysis right that's what it is so um so in terms of this then um part of the big problems that we have today came from the Clinton Administration um allowing the loophole of letting companies put their headquarters in Ireland famously Apple does this um so that all of your transactions take place offshore which means that you have effectively chose as a state and passing these laws Democratic decisions to pass laws to allow huge amounts of money to go outside the system so those companies don't have to pay taxes um so American earning statements they look like money losers they pay zero taxes and profit shift and costs oh well more than 60 billion the um what is it it's not oecd it's not Greenpeace it's the other one anyways there's so much stuff on tax avoidance wealth avoidance and there's the tax Justice UK does nothing but this they have great data on this on this is just hundreds of billions of dollars every year because of a decision made in the U.S about how taxes are reported and so the idea here is that this the livability of people for that top group is is increased in in proportion massively and everybody else is kind of stuck where they were um not only that the idea of of what is valued and how we value it then if there's more and more money out there remember and it's like the stock market's 85 institutional investors and 85 percent of it's totally automated they maintain the stock exchange in order to prevent like provide the theater that there's a market there but in fact it's dominated by a very small group of of um investment funds mutual funds and institutional investors but one of the weird Parts about this then is that like these firms that don't pay taxes have valuations that are in really really high because everyone can see hey they don't have to pay taxes they're going to do pretty well or we say we're going to put all our money into them because that's where the future goes and we want to invest in the future of technology so you hit these weird inversions that say like things like the stock market and how much people are worth don't actually reflect reality per se now this is a classic Marxist argument I don't agree with it at all it does reflect reality but whatever um so we have this in in 2021 where Tesla is worth more than all of the other car makers combined um that Tesla produces uh you know eight uh billion in Revenue but is worth a trillion and Ford and GM um are worth way more but their stock their valuations way less like the number of vehicles that Tesla produces versus all the rest is it's significant this is actually improved a bit Tessa's got more and everybody's betting on electric so that's what the bet is here they're all betting on electric but in terms of like how things work or who's employed where all the rest of those companies are producing the bulk of the cars and they have the bulk of the workers but they're worth next to nothing or or not combined they're worth as much as one Tesla right and you can see that too in terms of firms that even in terms of their assets like Exxon is worth more in terms of its total assets than Apple or um or these other ones but their their stock price makes them more valuable and this is because we have these systems and structures made up so what all this means is that the more that we reinforce these structures of power the more the inequality increases and so this would be a Marxist analysis that we didn't get anything like in the textbook just the idea that um State capture happens so if you look at any of these um like Alec is really fascinating Alec is like a not-for-profit that exists who allow um a set of policies to be adopted in every state at every level because they write them all and then give them to all the different groups that want them normally Republicans give them all it's a republican organization it's not it's not-for-profit that works for politicians who are Republican so they don't have to write their own legislation these are funded by these big not-for-profit organizations that then write the legislation that Republicans pass that over reading right um this happens on the left as well this is what FTX was doing with SBF before he went under was funneling his crypto money into this producing left versions of this as well like they are going to be the ones that Foster um kind of innovative policies the all of these lab and there's a long history of this of of key billionaires supporting ideas and values that they um like and see and so we see this over and over again um this it's reinforcing this plutocratic bias endowments to universities um making sure that they help specific ideological organizations that reinforce their point of view rather than just giving money the poor right which is what tax if they pay more taxes which would happen right because it would be in the public offers um and so they're not really interested in fixing big problems like things in the public interest but promoted promoting Technical and technocratic fixes which they largely benefit from so tech chat GPT or llms or AI is going to change the world but we're not sure it's going to change the world for the better and it's those people at the ground floor that are going to be making the monies and so this is just a basic Marxist analysis as an example because there wasn't any examples in the text of why it could still be relevant and how it's really easy to make these arguments you don't need to use big words because you can do it in meme form
