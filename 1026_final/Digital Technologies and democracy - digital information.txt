 why digital technology matters okay I guess um yeah here's some here I'll start getting into some of these these kind of short biting criticisms and we'll get into this is so messed up listen to how Tick Tock is different for kids in China versus kids in the United States in their version of tick tock if you're under 14 years old they show you science experiments you can do at home Museum exhibits patriotism videos and educational videos and they also limit it to only 40 minutes per day now they don't ship that version of tick tock to the rest of the world so it's almost like they recognize that technology is influencing kids development and they make their domestic version a spinach version of tick tock while they ship the Opium version to the rest of the world this is I think that was Tristan Harris there um so having these digitally enabled politics means that we've got some taciting explicit I mean this is cyber optimism cyber pessimism but it requires a level of government control I don't know how much we're comfortable with that government control can look like this as well do you this thing Pantry item this this those are pretty bad honey Tick Tock hates the H word h-o-n-e-y I was making history videos and I made one about the history of um and since then I've been a semi-shadow band because for some reason Tick Tock hates that word and people in my comments have been like that same thing happened to me uh that's because um there's a whole bunch John Oliver's and I've done is uh she is um president XI in China has persistently been mocked as being a Winnie the Pooh or Pooh Bear and then as a consequence then these systems are developed in order to to make sure that ideas that are critical of the Chinese government don't get platformed as much or maybe not I don't think it's as simple as a one-to-one really relationship but we absolutely know things like Tiananmen and that even like things like me too when they emerge over and over again in these networks if you control the networks you can make them go away if it's an open network Charter and so this idea of thinking about digitally enabled politics then we we've largely framed it in terms of the western experience in terms of digital government campaign and voting there's nothing wrong with framing it like that but we have to think about the ways in which um government capacity is kind of built into these things um the idea of enhanced Services um famously Australia has went to a digital uh driver's license and that digital driver's license has a massive security vulnerability that basically lets anybody Photoshop their age into it and it's been a persistent problem um so you would want to the the idea is is that providing access to the internet because it is a human right now is is the special reporter but there's a special reporter on on human rights and internet access because so much of what we do is online and so you would think that this would be better like Estonia and this idea of like having an Estonian digital citizenship anybody can be Estonian citizens or participate in that economy would be great um paying things or participating in this stuff online but but we saw that even in Ontario they had a system that you could renew your driver's license at a kiosk in malls and had to rip them all out and shut them all down because there was just rampant fraud right and so all of these Notions about how we think about this participation and how we do it the early kind of vision of the internet internet 1.0 as well here we'll put up a poll and people will vote on it and then we'll get the outcomes but then you get the polls being dictated by people who say horrible things and because it's hilarious it's boaty mcboatface or whatever but you know you can do all sorts of monstrous stuff here too and so um you know digital technology is not fundamentally alter government but it's this question of certainly they've had to respond but they always respond to New Media right the fireside chat is a form of responding to New Media famously like the interwar um uh Canadian Prime Ministers were horrible in terms of their like Charisma but they were effective leaders so they didn't but they didn't need those skills right and so I don't know if I I think that one of the dangers of moving towards a political system that we have where media is so integral to elections is that we are now voting more on a on the perception of the candidate than actually listening to the candidate but then again I don't know what debates have ever done right they reinforce and so you you would like to use digital Technologies to inform persuade and mobilize voters during election campaigns you know you know Obama and Trump um both using Twitter as kind of platform strategies um but the idea here is that you know Communications political strategy messaging hasn't changed all that much gaffes are still the same going viral there's nothing new about going viral we've always had moments that like how we're Dean's Yeehaw or whatever got him kicked out of the the possibility of being president right what is seen as non-presidential right um Biden fall over on a bike and it's fine um and so you know it's all of these Notions about uh how we deal with this and so voters are feel like they're part of the campaign but like honestly in a two-party system like in the U.S who cares what people feel like you understand the oligarchy argument coming in here um so one of the things that happens then on this I'll just jump right into it uh is is the danger of these systems now they've always been this way um I guess we just haven't been as cognizant of them or without the two-way communication we weren't able to to do these things and and um this I don't know that the liberal media has ever been any different than it is like the the grand old lady the New York Times has set the agenda for like U.S war making for a century I don't know that that's changed but this ability to call it out I think probably has changed and so that might be new um but what it's calling out is yeah I mean this dystopian nightmare of Technology Tony who's Jessica Headley and I'm Ryan Wolfe our greatest responsibility is to serve our Treasure Valley communities the El Paso Las Cruces communities Eastern Iowa communities Mid Michigan communities we are extremely proud of the quality balanced journalism that cbs4 news produces but in the country plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media more alarming some media Outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first the sharing of biased false news checking cash and this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is Extreme dangerous to our democracy extremely dangerous dangerous to our democracy microsocracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy uh good times so yeah I don't know I don't have any good um basis upon which I can say um consensus building has always been the purpose of policy um either responding to or or reacting to so the idea that we produce information over and over again I participated I was on the Cambridge analytical website I gave them access to my Facebook profile because my academic Facebook profile is literally academic you can just add me on there it doesn't matter I don't do Facebook otherwise um and I've largely deleted all my Twitter accounts now too there's just and I have like I think eight different Tick Tock profiles um so anyways the idea here is that um we reproduce information over and over again and then that makes reality um so I don't know the metaness of that is that is it fake news or is the message actually fine because we're all in agreement that what they're saying is true being forced to I'll say it's I'm seems dystopian but I don't know if that dystopian-ness is in there all I will say you don't need to know too much about it Facebook gotten a lot of trouble a lot of fines dragged before Congress and in the UK over the Cambridge analytical Scandal um the idea was is that uh you can go into this as a great podcast um uh I think it's behind the lines uh Mike uh Michael Lewis the one who did the great short and all the rest he has a podcast with the guy who created Cambridge analogica and all the stats say that it had almost a negligible impact um but the perception was is that it caused brexit and so the perception was the reality and so they paid a fine and did all the rest of it and so what we get then are all sorts of ways in which news is circulating um the weird part about this one I don't want to get too much into it but macron was there was a false claim made against Emmanuel macron in France the consensus reporting was that it was false news everybody reported it as false but the debunking of it was that people believed it and that it had all of these ways in which it reproduced the debunking of it still reproduced the idea and so the one of the premises here is that we shouldn't call it fake news because that's not helping news has always had this problem of of propaganda of false balance of disinformation there's nothing really new about that it's just become a way to delegitimate all sources in order to produce reinforce the bubbleness of it um if the term fake news is insufficient and dangerous because it has been appropriated by politicians around the world to basically assert at anybody they don't like or they don't think is dealing with stuff so fake news is a mechanism to clamp down on Free Press and undermine Trust in Media um uh producing this all over and over again these these narratives over and over again I I don't know how much media we should trust but I do know that the digitization of it has reinforced this idea that we shouldn't engage with ideas that we don't like and so a better term for fake news is junk news because it saturates public debate leaving little space for other discussions and reducing the richness of public debate being heard um it's this idea this is back to durkheim which is again why I don't know any of this is new was was that um Collective phenomena would reduce everything to the simplest form of individual behaviors and their their Progressive we would stop thinking and we would just react and so when we talk about junk news production it's this is all media has always been like this we've always had tabloids we've always had this stuff but part of the defunding of news is that it produces more junk and so when we don't engage in those institutions that are worthy at least of some type of doing the work and keeping people accountable whoever they are we produce everything and this has already been the case with chat GPT we I think there's about at least 50 at this point news websites that are just churning AI created data over and over again in order to you know get caught up in search engines so when you type in a response you get whatever whatever the data is and it's just garbage data produced by AI that hasn't been checked it's not fact checked it's not anything it's junkiness it's pure and so when we automate news news Services we junk them but the long history of the AP is more complicated anyways so that there are five types of junk news production we could talk about um one it's just the establishment of a market so the buzz feedification of things like whatever the crazy headline is so there whatever the headline is so that everybody will go there um the idea of of junk news is something that I can produce my own news and you can listen to it I can do my own tick tocks uh technological this ways in which we propagate the news so that I can create I have a platform like Tick Tock where it can spread uh cultural this idea of creating a subculture for whatever furries whatever and then generating content for that group and then political in in the act of trolling and so hopefully we'll get to this there's a link in it here but this is the the crap test and so we should always do this this is this is time and Memorial this is kind of the purpose of the academy right if there's one thing the academy should do it should be thinking critical thinking that's it right at bare minimum it also provides degrees it's social sorting and it lets you um lets employers know that you're capable of having certain skill set right and then then you've got your area expertise but but it at a basic level you know is your Source up to date is the source relevant to your research where is it published who is the author so this has always been the problem with the economist The Economist doesn't have authors you never know who's saying what so when they decided to publish it why don't we have any people defending the long history of slavery as an economic institution nobody takes the direct heat they just have to retract the stupid article they did like three years ago and are they considered repeatable and trustworthy in their field and that's loaded right because that is epistemic bias right so if we all really like somebody or we all really hate somebody you're going to reproduce that problem in your Authority accuracy is it supported by evidence and are there claims cited correctly sure one of the problems with large language models is we don't know where the data is being drawn from and they claim that they're not producing new data they're just synthesizing data um and then what's the purpose behind motivating it so we always have to think about crap it's not just about junk news or fake news we always have to check whatever sources we have and the digitization of society shouldn't change the ways in which we think about that
