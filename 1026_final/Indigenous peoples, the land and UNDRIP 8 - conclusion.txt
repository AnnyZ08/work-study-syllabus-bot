 so why by way of conclusion I mean it's an oxymoron Canadian history defined by settler colonialism indigenous dispossession and extractivism displacement through coercion treaties being replaced by ongoing Coachmen of indigenous lands extract policies heightened conflicts I don't know if they're heightened that's just a way to frame it as presentism um face these questions ongoing um colonialism as this force in politics is you know prime minister power claiming there is no history of this kind of colonial relationship this framework of U.N drip you know is putting obligations on the state that we're trying to do with things like the knowledgements but I'm not sure it's going to happen I don't even have an iota of a second to deal with policing and how the RCMP and policing and the long history of if you if we know anything about policing in the U.S policing in Canada in terms of imprisonment rates of incarceration of uh likelihood of of encountering with police is quite similar to the U.S in relationship I've got the data I'm just not going to put it here between indigenous communities and policing mechanisms so this I I don't love this video this is in the book I'll just show it and then we'll talk about it a bit and then move on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has offered to withdraw officers from a blocked pipeline service route on First Nations land in Northern British Columbia the RCMP said officers would leave whatsuit in territory if the road remained clear the offer follows two weeks of protests that have blocked construction of the coastal gaslink pipeline through hundreds of miles of an so your protests can only be a protest so long as it doesn't disrupt what kind of protests are non-disruptive that's not protesting that's I guess virtue signaling right isn't that complaining about virtual signaling you're talking about doing things but you're not actually doing things anyways indigenous land on Thursday Canadian officials welcomed rcmp's offer as a significant step toward a more Peaceable Arrangement that would end the blockade which began earlier this month last year the British Columbia Supreme Court granted an injunction to Coastal gaslink that banned any interference with the multi-billion dollar project but in January whatso attend leaders informed the company it was trespassing on First Nations land British Columbia's Government tried to mediate the dispute but talks broke down after a few days protesters began blocking the service road the RCMP then moved in to enforce the injunction and arrested demonstrators the arrest triggered solidarity protests across Canada as well as the Nationwide shutdown of commuter rail Services Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government's working toward finding a negotiated solution that would benefit all parties you remind us rightly so the too often trust has been betrayed in the history of indigenous negotiations with Canadian governments in fact that underlines the difficulty of solving this situation today but our common ground is solving solving solving solving solving our situation today solving the it is framed in terms of a specific problem that needs a specific solution it's not framed in whether or not the problem was created or how it was created or if it's a viable problem to have in the first place the desire to arrive at Solutions we cannot resolve this alone opposition to the coastal gaslink pipeline reportedly dates back to 2012 but it does maintain support from 20 elected First Nations band councils along the Route however wet sweats and hereditary Chiefs say construction cannot proceed without their consent so this is the question I mean these are the questions and we can talk about these in class and how this is thing and I think we went through all of these I made sure to do that and then the unseated lands and consent so um those were all covered um so yes this is a complicated issue that I can't even adequately deal with in one lecture but this is just kind of introduction to the main ideas I do think extractivism is a good way to think about this and settler colonialism as an ongoing practice rather than framed in terms of past it's it's very present it will continue to be present it's not going anywhere
