 okay [Music] um dealing with the idea of political normativity then means that we have to come to terms of what are we saying we should do right we have these Alternatives but we need to think about what we mean by these things social justice okay social under human Justice ecological Justice attuned to relationships and domination support and subordination ecocentric egalitarian values the goal is not merely to understand the world but to change it aren't we doing that in the climate change aren't we changing it too radically um I don't know that this is disruptive as critique political ecology seeks to expose the flaws in the dominant approaches the environment favored by corporate State and international authorities working to demonstrate the point of view of local people margin group vulnerable it works to denaturalize certain social and environmental conditions showing them to be the contingent outcomes of power not inevitable I think that's what we would do in the whole course right try to figure out how contestation happens I it can be post positivist I don't know what needs to be we've got lots of positivist evidence that these are problems that we need to address so it introduces this idea of critical realism but doesn't really explain what it is it's just the idea of this notion that that there's a world um independent of our thoughts and perceptions organized in different ways and this goes back to remember the I don't know if everybody watching The Tick Tock video but the dog perception or that filter you can put on Tick Tock to see the way that dogs see the world we are limited by our the meat sacks of our brain is in our eyes and the cones and the vision that we see there are clearly stuck beyond our visible realm and sounds beyond our audible realm things that happen in the world that we can't understand based on our current ways of seeing but that we can scientifically show that exist but without that science we don't know they exist and so this idea of recognizing the limits of our knowledge is also about our ability to perceive these things and then recognize that perception as politically useful so we want to explain how these problems happen and work for change but we need to be able to to do so and so perception then is also about like I don't know what any of this means but it's interesting to think about it so this is a new close-up clip of a plant breathing so this was captured over there in San Diego at the University of California and it's absolutely amazing so just to kind of explain what's going on here so plants they're the exact opposite of us right so we breathe in oxygen and then exhale carbon dioxide and then plants use their little mouths which are these called stomata to take in that carbon dioxide and release oxygen it's such an amazing balance we give them what they need to survive and they in turn give us what we need to survive so this to us does that matter does it make significant to us that we can see plants breathing does it matter to us that that grass when you cut it releases a sound or impact to that around it that you could call screaming I don't know if you would want to do that because then it makes it harder to eat things right things we identify with become harder harder to kill and so I've got it here this is what um this is what Peta has argued because I mean we Are overfishing we almost overfished all of our our fish stocks so maybe we wouldn't overfish so much if we called them sea kittens because then we perceive them through the realm of human Memorial kind of reciprocity right like mammals they do this all the time and mammals take care of other mammals offspring sometimes they eat them sometimes take care of them there's no predicting per se what what's going to happen weird situations produce weird outcomes but this idea that if we put some anthropocentric mammalianism into fish maybe we would be less likely to kill them on mass and so this is this this idea that thinking about critical realism the textbook doesn't do this but this is an interesting world that the idea of pollution for example is largely framed in terms of human experience and the impact it has on the life that we see as valuable more normally because we either value it because we we like it or because it feeds us we don't see it necessarily as intrinsically valuable because there are certain things that we we see our pests or weeds or problems invasive right that are upsetting what we see as a natural order natural Being Framed as equilibrium rather than this equilibrium it's not clear that that's the case and so we're limited by the cognition that we see what we see how we experience it we use the word like that the mug is blue rather than the mug Blues because it's actually just the light that's bouncing off it and the cones in our eyes that can perceive it whereas dogs see it or don't in different ways so for them it may not be right and so this idea of of human fallibility um is also part of of human reason because what we reason is what we can can prove and so we have these Transformations and and uh science all the time when we discover oh crap the way we've been doing stuff has is wrong and we have to rethink all the ways we've been doing it but we were doing that based on scientific method on what we have at the time and so the Assumption of that teleological progress is that we are moving towards a better outcome but in terms of global climate change I don't have evidence of that and so jevin's Paradox is is that example right this idea of the idea that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase and not decrease fuel use so if that's the case then it's not clear that we are moving in that direction and then there is the question that's come up of late of whether or not the rest of the world wants us or that it it's happy with what we're doing and so this has been going on and I don't know how to interpret it we could just interpret it as one's experience who is now mobilizing others against us but it's this is a map showing 59 orca attacks off the coast of Portugal but it doesn't even include the recent attacks in 2022 and 2023 they've gotten a lot of media attention for two reasons one they actually managed to sink some boats and two it looks a lot like one orca is teaching the others different techniques for disabling boats and that's what I want to focus on is orca intelligence because their brains are remarkable they have the highest degree of gyrification or the wrinkliness of their cortex of any animal as well as an incredibly well developed insular cortex which is responsible for casual things like Consciousness empathy compassion and self-awareness the language abilities that orcas display as pack hunters and social creatures all of their lives are incredible so science has given us this information which is great but at the turn of the century Industrial Revolution every light post in London was lit with whale oil so okay we don't do that as much anymore so I guess that's good these are some of the sounds that Wiki and orca and Marineland France learn to mimic from humans hello Amy [Music] even more impressive to me is the fact that one orca that was socialized with dolphins essentially learned to speak dolphin in that the frequency and Cadence of its chirps changed range to be within the minimum to maximum dolphin range rather than the normal Orca range scientists also know that each Community has its own unique sounds so these three PODS of orcas near me in the Sailor sea make up one community and they have sounds they can use when they all come together but each pod has its own Unique Sounds relative to their hunting tactics and sounds they only use to signify one member of the group which to me that means names and the other orcas do not understand those sounds nor use them they're learned sounds this study quantifies their remarkable ability to teach and learn from one another which I will show the experimental and observational evidence for it so I don't know how you interpret this data um it's just data you can reject it out of hand and say no humans are still more important than orcas you can put it as equivalent they are at least on some more level should be given some type of personhood and then you could go further and say looks like they're kind of mad and that trauma of that one orca who's teaching the others is kind of like that orcas put up with it but are you willing to go that far and understand that as a form of political conflict I don't I don't have any evidence that you're going to do that we can talk about this in class but I don't have a ton of evidence that you're willing to make that leap to recognize that maybe parts of the environment are mad at us and are trying to get us back for what we've done but we don't like to think in those ways and so this chapter says critical realism as if it's just like oh well you know it's just these precepts but if you push it far enough it gets pretty radical we just don't see any of that in the chapter
