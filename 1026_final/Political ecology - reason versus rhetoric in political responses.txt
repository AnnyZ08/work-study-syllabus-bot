 we can link these patterns back to things that we tend to identify in politics all the time these Concepts aren't particularly I would say well-defined um in that the relationship between these two ecologically is clearly linked to extractivism right this damagement of lands from settlements uh commercial Agriculture and research extraction I'm not I don't know how much the concepts themselves can be ecologically unpacked the colonial relationships span pre-industrial to Industrial eras so they still have this element of hierarchy but that I don't I am hesitant to say that everything looks the same in all these experiences over space and time and so the idea of of moving with one framework to say colonialism and imperialism lead to development which leads to this is probably more complicated than that um clearly the colonies have different experiences with development different relationships to Colonial powers and then different roles in Food Systems and the production of of uh forms of natural resources that are extracted some can make money off at some can't some are subject to biopiracy some are the places where crops are are farmed sugar cane cocoa rum whatever that Dynamic is is probably different and to to hit them with all the same label is probably not a good understanding of these relationships and so what we do know about colonialism imperialism these forms of hierarchy going back in time is that they have produced this outcome right the richest 10 percent are responsible for all of almost half of total lifestyle consumption emissions and the bottom uh 50 are only responsible for 10. so that does imply some political responsibility but I don't know what that means for our food systems and our systems of extraction how much water should you wash your jeans there's an argument you put them in the freezer right you shouldn't use them they use a huge amount of water they have a huge amount of CO2 but they last a long time they're they're not disposable they're probably better than fast fashion stuff from Zara or whatever um you know does this change how we think what we should eat and who should eat and what kind of um products have the biggest impact um does it matter that these relationships are impacting things like bees and insects are seeing these massive declines and so the problems then for political science are framed in terms of this crisis I don't know when it starts and I don't know how we distinguish between what was a colonial and Imperial and the settler Colonial experiences on an impact how we think about these things so so if we are this sixth Max Extinction event we've have these collapse in all these species we have different actors trying to respond to this and then these moral considerations about decentering the human perspective and then the non-human species stuff you know granting protected status to spaces and environments right um you know we're pledging to stop this but we're still running out um these are you know hot spots in the the uh um intensified Amazon rainforest and then the question becomes okay so what should our relationship to these events be um and I I am sympathetic to to both sides of this debate here this don't look up moment is shockingly similar to the real life UK news clip trying to tell you that the entire planet is about to be just be destroyed well it's um you know just something we do around here you know we just keep the bad news light right it helps the medicine go down oh you see John You're outside enjoying the sunshine it's not too hot is it I can see in front of me are frightening so we all like nice weather but this will not be nice weather this will be potentially lethal weather for a couple of days it'll be brief but it'll be brutal I want us to be happy about the weather maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn't supposed to be fun I don't know whether Something's Happened to meteorologists to make you all a little bit fatalistic and and harbing is a doom because all of the broadcasts particularly on on the BBC every time I've turned on anyone's talking about the weather they're saying that there's going to be tons of fatalities but haven't we always had hot weather but heat waves are becoming more extreme this is yet another one which is coming down the track towards us and you know I don't think we should be too lighted light-hearted about the fact that many are going to die early next week because of the heat 40 degrees the sort of temperature of this country I'm afraid it's just not geared up to cope with so we have this issue or these are old standing problems and then we are presented with the evidence and we're like ah don't worry about it and so that beneficial system I'm not sure like can you honestly I don't know like it's tough when you look at these numbers and we are mostly in the Western World sitting up here do we ask nicely um how does this happen that's what I mean about this political ecology I think we're caught in the same Fabian socialism of the UN we know there's a problem here's a problem but we have to choose the right way to respond to it and when we're forced to choose between like having a hamburger or not we choose the hamburger and we enjoy it there's nothing wrong I think with enjoying things it's just I'm not sure that the individual choice is going to be mitigated quick enough to deal with these deep systemic social crisis and glowing growing inequality and those who benefit from that inequality have all the hierarchy mechanisms in them and so this idea of of pollution happening you know industrial pollution agricultural runoff is is producing this um we're losing massive jellyfish blooms huge carbon sinks coral reef despairing my father-in-law is he's a marine geologist has done nothing but examine coral reefs um and you know uh sunscreen right sunscreen is just brutal for coral reefs you're not supposed to wear it but I I get sunburned easily it's a tough one to call and so do we are we going to frame this and we've had there's already a subset of political science literatures looking about water conflicts right the ways in which water exacerbates but isn't seen as directly causing conflict it just makes conflictual situations worse we have this problem of waste of the food supply of um you know the US is five percent of the world population produces 30 of its garbage this idea that we throw out landfill we're doing stuff we see it in the store all the time you know the the banged up groceries we just don't like to do it and then these questions about recycling been you can look up in your individual Community but often recycling bins just end up in waste because when China decided for example it's not going to recycle cardboard anymore we ran into this problem where our perverse outcomes are that it's cheaper to produce new cardboard in terms of energy and cost than it is to recycle it and so we get these weird inversions that happen E-Waste you know everybody producing 176 pounds per year often hazardous we get toxic trade and Asbestos and DDT these things banned and that these it you can't really see it here but the if you look at the change of price of certain things the things that are the cheapest are the things that cause the most E-Waste so how often do you go through a phone the planned obsolescence of your phone we used to say the planned Ops lessons of vehicles was gross the planned obsolescence of phones with all these things in it and then this extractivism right I talked about this before about the idea that a lot of the Canadian economy is built on the extractivism in in places like Africa and so how how would we change those systems in terms of air pollution and climate change all of these mechanisms should come in and then we made a lot of headways with things like the Montreal protocol and then we found out um we were stopping the CFC chlorofluorocarbons that were leading to a buildup of heat in the atmosphere and we had made a lot of progress on it but then when they did a survey with satellites they found out that just two places in looks like China and then that must be off the coast of South Korea there one of the islands they were leaking CFCs at massive levels but if we didn't surveil them we wouldn't have known this and so we can move forward but we have to be vigilant and I'm not sure how Vigilant we are those scientists discovered it from satellite imagery it wasn't something that was discovered by Chinese regulation and so this idea of melting ice as a threat to coastal cities we see this already in places like Miami with flooding and collapses and stuff like that all those ways in which we do it so how do we fix these things well more often than not we go back to the state we try to do it in terms of things like ecological citizenship which then creates all of these weird eco-fascist things that we've talked about throughout the course this idea that good citizens versus bad citizens and gosh knows how that's going to go um and then carbon democracy this idea of that we should have more equitable distribution or Equitable claims but again I don't know what these look like in terms of of forcing political Solutions or making these Solutions we have this idea oh there's a type of other steady state growth these efforts to Green the state Green State but we don't have any examples currently of a green State we have environmental welfare states like Sweden and the Netherlands pushing towards Eco modernization and then we have market-based Solutions like Australia and the USA trying to push towards those we just don't know if these these mechanisms these political mechanisms we have are are well suited to fixing these problems and so the idea then of of the first world having to pay its Fair fair share would require us to you know do things like pay taxes which you don't even want to do so this idea of the ecological Foundation of North American of sprawl consumer capitalism expansion is all bound up in things like the growth of urbanization urbanization is from our food systems if you've only got two percent producing the food 98 is pushed into cities which means we're then more dependent on those cities over and over when those cities grow and take up arable Farmland we're one of those problems we talked about before and so by 2030 you know 60 of the the population will be in urban areas and one in three will be in a city of fifty thousand or more which makes us more dependent on these systems pursuing ideas like pushing us to more ecologically sustainable systems doesn't make sense if we're living in cities and so slums then could be a kind of failure on both levels of of the kind of the product of of modernization of development um and that we increasingly don't put infrastructure and we're not developing Green State mechanisms and then this idea of how we should think about the right to housing and what's an ecologically sound right to housing and who should deal with it and so the global climate change crisis is this idea that political science should be dealing with these issues we should do this interdisciplinary stuff um but we have this political economy of climate change denialism um that we have Global Justice movements but we that small group at the top is going to have to to deal with this and this bifurcation that the West does is between we want to see two because it's easier to see two sides rather than see like the all of the issues that are involved in these things and so we see conflict coming from global climate change but we're not sure those mechanisms are resulting in change that one's really sad um and so the idea then is that we've got all political parties then in our oppositional systems not all agreeing even on the the fundamental premise right the more that these um organizations and these mobilizations argue that humans are still the center of the system and we should primarily be concerned with what humans and humans do and what's best for maximizing human benefit is countered to all of these other questions and so the power of rhetoric is still here we don't need which science alone is not enough to convince us we have to mobilize those political systems in order to make us consensus building and I'm not sure that we are at a point of consensus building and so the idea of irrefutable evidence doesn't have anything to do with politicization the politicization of evidence is going to involve reason versus rhetoric and so they democracies in particular have been fairly successful with using rhetoric to counter reason and so those are all examples uh the Alberta conservatives Trump and voluncero while doing this versus these youth voters demanding action in terms of these issues so political ecology introduces these Concepts and ideas I'm not sure it provides what it says it will which is it ends up in a Fabian socialist outcome where we know we need to take change but we're not sure what we're willing to do to to take it we're not sure which commitments we're willing to make in order to do that are we talking about Green state are we talking about what social welfare Estates are we talking about ecological modernization through the markets and so all of these things would imply that we need to change our hierarchies and consider the rights of non-human species I'm just not sure how many of you are willing to do that and as a consequence of that then we want to have this this emergence of the political Ecology of health because increasingly climate change and health are interrelated and that ecology and ecological economics are in here um but we don't have any better systems than we had in week one of dealing with the idea that some people are going to make claims that are accepted by them the those who are the dominant group or the the largest group in the hierarchy and everybody else who doesn't have access to those resources and so we end up in that space again
