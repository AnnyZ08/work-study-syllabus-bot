 okay Welcome to our discussion of international relations um I was the director of the international relations or IR program um for I guess about seven or eight years um until just recently um so the international relations program deals with this realm of politics so that's what my degree was in it was actually an international political economy in East Asian studies that's what I got my degree in and I did my dissertation on protest movements in around trade agreements in Seoul South Korea and Toronto okay so um we are going to identify this idea of what makes the international separate from kind of domestic politics Will distinguish between international relations and um Global the global politics so or what happens at the global level we'll review three theoretical approaches um I'm going to add in some of my own examples I don't feel that there's I I actually don't even know what marxian is it's a weird expression it feels to me like somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about writing about it so I bring in my own examples on that and then these three kind of disruptive theories constructivism post structuralism and gender analysis again I don't really feel we have a good clear examples so I'll bring in my own examples uh to supplement the textbook and then we'll talk about a little bit about this idea of ir Theory and covid but not much right um again because I think we're all coveted out at this point okay um so when we when we talk about political events or how we think about political contestation so if if in political science we can test all ideas when it comes to the international realm when we can test ideas we're doing so in ways that are often much broader in scope so for example if we um this if we want to analyze something like the ways in which NATO intervenes to get rid of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in 2011. Conflict here isn't just between different actors or different groups in society it's now a whole bunch of different actors across societies getting together to intervene and so when we talk about IR theories or different approaches um we're talking about the specific ways we can understand those events so how do U.S Britain France and Canada get involved in overthrowing a regime in Libya right um why do they do that how do they do that and how is that contestation theorized is it the same as the Internationals or as the domestic system where there's a single actor who gets to decide who is a legitimate speaker and has the legitimate use of the Monopoly of violence no and we'll talk about why that is and so part of the reason that it isn't the same is that the cooperation that takes place generally between societies is boar so when you're talking about the cooperation in a in a domestic realm between different groups it's normally just seen as social conflict political protest social contestation sometimes Civil War but on the international level it's often just straight Warfare so the international then isn't everything that is global because it's not necessarily things that are international so in Canada we have an indigenous French and an English tradition we could frame that as International they're different nationalities that are interacting and to some extent prior to 1648 um this actually was how Affairs took place we didn't have established States so much of what we saw even Athenian city-states and things like that where where interactions between different groups but that's generally not what we mean when we say International because it's it's distinct and I'll talk about why that is um we also um aren't really talking about geopolitics we'll get into that a bit more when we talk about order geopolitics is things like the idea of an Empire or um setting up uh the Cold War into camps where certain um geographical based conflicts happen and we're strategically valuing things like resources and capacities and those type of things and then um we'll talk about globalization a bit as the idea of the global and we're not sure so States absolutely facilitate globalization but they also kind of resist globalization I teach the global competition rise of Asia course which used to be called globalization so um that course we look at the ways in which this the different theories about globalization happen and there is a subset an examination of of relations that are called globalization that don't fully fall into what we call international relations so the problem is basically scale right um when we think about things at a at a domestic level we can talk about well we know who the Supreme Court is we probably know who the Monarch the ruler or the the Prime Minister President is and we probably know that the laws passed stem from this long tradition you know of this idea of either in the in the British tradition that's common law or we've got this constitutional law in the U.S there's some foundation for that but at the international level it's totally different because there is no like overriding Authority that can set everything for everybody because nobody agrees on anything where they all have different societies different Traditions different cultures different understanding and so things like Law and Order and policy even ideas aren't the same at the global level as they are at this the state level and so we have to explain these things and we can have these Frameworks and this is the key thing similar to when we talk about politics it these are not exhaustive Frameworks um and so like in in Natural Science theories we would try to explain something with in terms of causality um we can do correlation in political science we can't really do causality because there are overlapping events and issues taking place that have different forms of correlation so if we want to talk about the ways in which capitalist exploitation takes place we have to use a framework that talks about that whereas if we want to talk about Interstate conflict we have to use a framework that talks about that they're distinct theories and so the the we call them dominant theories I don't know that marxian theories maybe is the same as liberal and realistic there's a lot of term confusion here but whatever um and then these disruptive theories these Challengers again I'm not totally convinced but sure let's go with it um and then this idea of covet impacting I are actually I I don't agree even a little bit with this what I think we saw with kovid was like the black lives matters protests um the idea then that this highlights the ways in which other issues haven't been addressed and they come to the fore so we have things like global climate change decolonization anti-racist Reckoning they're more significant and have more impact on how we think about IR than covet did the closest would be that kovid provided some idea that there could be Global events and therefore we have to start thinking global climate change like the next Global event but the problem of the levels of analysis and why we do international relations distinct from regular political analysis is primarily because it's famously called two level games you can be a great well-respected leader like internationally Marcon or macron or Justin Trudeau um are are perceived of as like good International leaders but domestically they get all sorts of uh criticism or and the other ways like Trump could have at least some clear support domestically um that allows him to do things but internationally he's got none and so we need to be able to explain those differences um in some type of framework and so we have this tension all the time between that which is is um the perceptions that happen around the world and then the Frameworks that can explain what's happening and so we have this this problem when I say I I will say IR over and over again it's my own tacit um bias towards the expertise of of this field right it's a way of of being exclusive about the ways that we think about things so when I say IR I mean this is what I'm talking about versus other fields because they'll have their own reference points in the ways in which they do things and so IR then sees the world as largely bound or the the kind of foil that we were reflect on is the power of the nation-state either that it's powerful or not powerful enough right one way or the other um and so this will come back to we'll come back to in the next video is the question of structural Anarchy so you know no matter how many criticisms we have of whatever state we're in whether it's the North Korean state or whether it's Chinese state or whether Canadian State we still have a referent point over and over again that someone is in charge right we might not like that they're in charge we might really like that they're in charge but someone is in charge at the international level that's doesn't function it's we it's structural Anarchy we don't have agreement that one actor is in charge in fact there's lots of efforts by other actors to say that person shouldn't be in charge I'm going to form my own Alliance to make sure that person isn't in charge and so what we're doing then is we're trying to understand the ways in which what happens at the domestic level when it it jumps up to the international level to what extent those theories are the same or to what extent we need new models so global politics then which you'll often see mood around isn't the same as as IR it's a broader and more inclusive term it includes more actors the role of non-state actors gender class race all of those things will come in um settler colonialism right is largely absent from this state-centric Theory it can it can have a role in decolonization decolonization movements and efforts to challenge kind of racist ways in which we think about the world and so global politics then has this relationship then between those two levels so all throughout this this book we've been talking about kind of the global impacting the very local global global global local so international relations is trying to go in between global politics and domestic politics kind of fit in the middle and so it's this this constant kind of question about which level it is and so this is a classic this is Mir shimer he's a very I guess we would say conservative classical realist none of us could understand the world we live in or make Intelligent Decisions without theories indeed all students and practitioners of international politics rely on theories to comprehend their surroundings some are aware of it some are not some admit it some do not but there's no escaping the fact that we cannot make sense of the complex world around us without simplifying theories Maybe so this isn't I mean it is Theory like traditional theory it's theory in the ways in which we Define um a framework that we are going to study and how we're going to study that framework and then what that framework will tell us about what it is we're studying so um it's not like a universal theory of gravity that postulates something for all time well it kind of does but postulate something that we can demonstratively uh prove one way or the other that's never going to happen you're going to have evidence that fits your theory and you can have evidence that doesn't fit your theory and then you're gonna have different groups that are fighting about whether or not that evidence fits your theory this is just parsimony simplifying things so all these simplifying theories are telling stories and they're incomplete stories necessarily in complete stories but they um capture that by saying they are a theory and so it's not theory in the kind of true abstract sense it's it's this claim that we have to kind of deal with stuff at the international level and so we're we have a complex situation we're going to simplify it that simplification has all sorts of violence right because a lot of these theories just never included race in their Theory at all so the Journal of race development um that's how we used to conceptualize things just became the journal Foreign Affairs and just doesn't mention there or didn't mention for the longest time that it used to be framed in those terms and so these theories also do all sorts of harm but it's inevitable because they're oversimplifying they can't be complex multifaceted open system theories because they wouldn't be able to explain anything so we are going to try to explain things we're going to decide what matters and what doesn't so we're going to say either we're because we're fighting for the status quo so we are saying that the system we have is good we've got to fight for these institutions the UN matters all the rest of this or we can say you know the liberal order is crumbling we have Challengers all over the world who aren't adopting these liberal premise liberalism has not resulted in enough net benefit for the rest of the world they are challenging these claims and so it's the idea that you're either for a status quo or for a challenger position and so this is uh um Robert Cox's favorite famous Proclamation that the study of global politics and the analysis of international relations Is inherently political it's always for someone and for some purpose so these theories themselves are contested we don't agree on them they're not complete but they tell a story that helps us make sense of the world and so when we look at events we can decide whether or not those events are ones that we consider important
