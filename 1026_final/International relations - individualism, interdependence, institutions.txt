 so if we have realism as a system of Anarchy we have liberalism um as a kind of offshoot of how we think about they overlap with domestic forms of liberalism um but they're a little bit different um primarily this is because individualism as a principle is something we we want to explain but we have to do it through things and so individuals always are kind of embedded in interdependent framework of the institutions in which they act and so this idea then is that um people or individuals so like human rights Target humans as individuals rather than saying that human rights come from the state and therefore it's up to State up to the state to ensure or that we put the primary responsibility we we do in terms of action but not in terms of theory right we say individuals have rights and so this is the the premise here um and so individuals choose to cooperate and they want to achieve gains and peace in the international Arena so unlike focusing on states which we are kind of a an artificial created body that like you have a prime minister or a President Who changes but they're still the leaders of that state we treat the state as the same um we have here the idea that individual actors do matter and that individuals have different characteristics and institutions reflect different values and ideas they're not all the same I was trying to find a good example of individualism individualism has its own weird Notions about it it as well individualism still situates things as cooperation but is always resistant to um famously their uh Hadley bull has this theory of an international society that somehow well if we're all individuals we must be in a global Society or globalism or cosmopolitanism but in general individualism um resists that so I used to have a conservative Senator come into classes before covid and he he would always say the individual is the most prosecuted um a group in human history I'm like well I mean maybe but that's a clear like oversimplification of the experience so this was just an example example of kind of hyper individual Alaska again Chachi PT recommended this I've never seen this movie I'm gonna be all the way out there all the way  out there just on my own you know no no watch no map no tax no nothing no nothing just be out there just be out there in it you know big mountains rivers sky games be out there in it you know in the wild what are you doing when we're there now you're in the wild you're just living man you're just there in that moment in that special place in time yeah maybe when I get back I can I can I can write a book about my travels I know about getting out of this sick Society Society Society you know Society because you know what I don't understand I don't understand why people why every  person is so bad to each other so often it doesn't make sense to me judgment control all that the whole Spectrum let's just what people we talking about carrots okay so that is American masculine Frontier idealism um this idea that the individual is is an island and that um there are all these systems trying to control the individual and the individual is oppressed right um so the idea here is that if we if we are individuals then we make choices and that reason dictates outcomes more than Anarchy Anarchy says like if you're a small state you don't have any say the matter right you're just positioned to try to constantly maximize your gains and minimize the likelihood that you're going to get wiped out whereas this says that no if the individual is the center of the system we can make reasonable choices and choose the best systems that reinforce the value of the individual and so that's the premise of of both interdependence and democratization right at the international level we have this it's a truism because it's not accurate in that there's counterfactual examples all over the case there's I can disprove it very easily in many cases but in general in the kind of broadest sense democracies don't go to war with one another and so what this means is that the the valorization of the individual and the right to vote in a democracy makes those democracies less than likely to attack other democracies because they also value individuals right um yeah that whether or not it has produced better outcomes could raise questions I don't know if we think democracy online has led to better like the comments section um is democratic and I don't know that that leads to better outcomes but this is the theory right it's why it's an incomplete Theory it's a myth it's a story it's one we tell because absolutely you can understand people choose to enter into relationships where they're not dominated by their parents God that's so embarrassing they're not dominated by other actors and so they choose and those that choice reflects forms of interdependence and it creates institution it builds relationships and so those types of relationships that are chosen are better than ones that you're forced into because of power relations and so it valorizes the individual and reason as choosing the best possible path so it has that natural teleology that I've been talking about throughout the course in it the idea that we are moving towards greater and greater systems controlled by realist thinking that is going to be Progressive because everyone's going to understand through reason the value of what it is they're trying to achieve we're moving away from more we're moving towards peace we're moving away from conflict towards cooperation the problem of course is that this is an is type of idealism it tends to hold up this premise that cooperation produces better outcomes even in the face of actors that are bad because it says if you've got an Iran or you've got a North Korea you should still try to integrate them into the system because over time that integration will lead to them adopting those values that interaction with others and the reason with others they will follow reasonable arguments and reasonable benefits over time primarily because you get this Collective action issue so if you're all small states and you all get together and you're the majority and there's only one bad actor one big actor out there they can no longer threaten your survival because you've entered into a system of interdependent cooperation and so this really reinforces the idea of of creating things so create a regime a framework that you can all agree on create an institution a a you know International atomic energy agency something that everybody agrees that if you've got nuclear weapons they have to be inspected and Norms the idea that you're going to follow each other and and produce the best action so one of the underlying premises of this system and I've written about this before is that olympism is actually framed as a social movement the thing that goes in the Olympics and it stems from this liberal system it actually predates the United Nations it was this form of the idea that if we could all get together at the same place and cooperate on anything doesn't matter what it would bring us closer together and make us more likely to follow the regimes norms and institutions of a good actor and so Sport and the Olympics in particular is seen as peaceful because it is a tie time there is a thing called the Olympic truce where the both sides will put down their their weapons in order to participate in the sport and so this is the idea of Peace stemming from reasonable action of cooperation now in the current moment we have seen this framework of olympism as a social movement be undermined progressively by the idea of sports washing that more and more regimes like Russia and Sochi or Saudi Arabia or Qatar are using sport to legitimate themselves build their Norms institution of regime access by utilizing sport where they don't have to actually change and so the question that stems from this is does Sport bring us together or drive us apart and so this is one of the kind of famous examples of the problems of framing things in these way during that period of time the word would be Carnival as U.S Sprinter Marty Glickman remembers it the view was grabbed for those two weeks in August of 1936 as Berlin hosted the world's greatest athletes for the 11th Olympic Games International visitors were warmly welcomed but behind the pump and pageantry were ominous signs the swastika was all over on virtually every other Banner we saw there was a swastika the benefit of hindsight and history helps us see these were more than just games these weren't the Berlin Olympics these were the Nazi Olympics they were also an opportunity for the regime to create the illusion of a new Germany on the world stage but the reality was quite different Jews were excluded from all German sports teams and clubs but the Nazis put Jewish International track and field star Gretel Bergman on the Olympic roster to fend off International critics removed from the German team at the last minute Margaret Lambert as she is now known recalls her reaction I would have been a loser either way because had I won there would have been such a an insult against the German psyche how can the a Jew be good enough to win the Olympics that I would have had to be afraid for my life I'm sure and had I lost I would have been made as a a joke off the field the truth about what the Nazis were doing was hard to miss many Americans could open their newspapers and on the front page they could see stories about what was going on in Nazi Germany so it certainly wasn't a secret by 1936 Germany's Jews and other minorities had been stripped of their civil rights even their citizenship and the Nazi regime had already opened its first concentration camps everybody knew everybody knew early on exactly the kind of regime Nazi Germany was so much so that for the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games there was talk about boycotting these games the debate raged they're all trying to decide what to do should they go did that mean that they would be somehow putting a stamp of approval on a regime that many people felt was abhorrent or was it just a sporting contest so this is so when we talk about like stick to sports this has always been attention in sports and international competition because of the liberal belief that they're not doing any harm by platforming these these societies because they will move towards the reason of the liberal premise right that that's that's what we we should do everyone's moving towards liberalism because it's a reasonable and right thing to do and these institutions engender the idea of cooperation clearly that wasn't the case here and in fact it can do the opposite because it legitimates those things I've got pictures of you know there were Nazi rallies in in Madison Square Gardens back in the 30s like this stuff also legitimates those regimes and so it cuts both ways right this idea of interdependence is supposed to make us more um likely to be like one another right so democracies don't fight each other um economies that cooperate General don't want to go to war with each other and the more that I can access the tourism and trade of another country the more I'm going to understand them and be less hostile towards them in theory but this idea of deepening free markets and and freedom in the political sphere is is an effort to persuade and cooperate using these common values and ideas which just I mean we've had almost 100 Years of preparation now maybe these regimes have figured out ways around it and so these International institutions are supposed to be the the common interests and show the the benefit of the liberal system of cooperation I don't know if the public goods created by reasonable States so part of what liberalism does as well is it also convinces the U.S that it should pay for these things so the U.S still continues to be a large part the largest contributor to the United Nations even as it criticizes and attacks it because it set up these institutions this is what's called embedded liberalism we embedded liberalism in these institutions because we believed in the value of those institutions and that anybody should be able to access them even those states that aren't liberal and so we're trying to achieve common interests through cooperation this was perceived as part of the failure of the interwar period that the interwar period led to fighting it led to the rise of Nazi Germany that the um the punishment after after World War One of demanding reparations for the cause of World War One LED to this interwar period that led to the rise of the Nazis this is the perception and so therefore as a consequence of that liberals believe we need to create strong central institutions to stop this from happening again we need to have a bank that is going to redevelop and not punish those who fought in the War we need to have a system of currency pegged to the American dollar that everybody can follow and we'll use a thing called the international monetary fund to make sure that those states can keep pegs to the U.S dollar so that we don't have anybody like trying to cheat each other on currency differences and then finally we'll have a liberal trading regime a World Trade Organization which will constantly establish more and more trade agreements to make sure that that we increasingly cooperate and we try to reduce tariffs so that nobody can punish Goods coming from another state everybody can trade freely and so this is seen as a parallel of well we have rules of law domestically so we'll establish rules of law internationally these institutions I I'd like to think of them when I teach the United Nations course I I'd frame International institutions as platforms the embedded character of the platforms um there's a couple uh articles written about this but it's the idea that the embedded character of the platforms these embedded liberal character means that it doesn't really matter what you do as long as you do it there right so as long as you use that platform it's effective like and we can see this with social media today we're like whatever the platforms everybody is on is the one people are going to use so even if we don't like the way that things are going in that platform until we've figured out a new one we're not going to use anything else because it's where everybody is so the League of Nations was the first efforts to establish a platform it failed because it said attack against one is attack against all and that just didn't happen right it over and over again States kept attacking each other and nobody responded so it failed so when they created the UN they said okay what we're going to do in this system is have a a relief valve that says the biggest most powerful actors who set this thing up will also have a veto power over any other State's intervention and so if there's no agreement there's no action so it is a platform where if you're going to go fight about an issue you're gonna go to the security Council and you're going to get your way famously the Soviets abstained during the Korean War and they realized quickly we are never abstaining again we're going to use our veto because if we abstain then that just lets the under the it was under you know mash and the intervention in the Korean War was under a U.N auspice because the Soviets abstained from the decision and that let everybody else say let's go into Korea and it didn't produce an outcome that anybody wanted so after that they were like if there's no agreement we're not doing interventions and so liberalism sees IR as more complex and multifaceted than realism this also brings us back to the thing that we started the chapter with which is the NATO intervention so the NATO intervention was an explicit effort to go around the UN because there wasn't any agreement at the U.N that this intervention should happen and they targeted that one specific regime so the NATO intervention then as a military intervention breeds the idea that realism is right and despite all of this rhetoric liberalism was wrong and that the states who championed liberalism still use realism when it's in their interest to do so this is why they're overlapping theories they help explain the same events in different ways and so this is this is the question I have and and it's just the idea of like whatever platform you're on is where you're going to have your discussions where you're going to make your decisions and that's where it's going to happen and as long as you're using it that's it and in the absence of something else it's going to be the successful one but this idea of having other mechanisms not a lot I mean you're in NATO or not and we're not sure that we want NATO policing the International System because we still think at least the UN system there is a possibility that other states can can veto what what is happening there so this idea of liberalism as an embedded institution or as a form of embedded individual rational cooperation is still how we frame the system it's the dominant framework that the International System Works under today
