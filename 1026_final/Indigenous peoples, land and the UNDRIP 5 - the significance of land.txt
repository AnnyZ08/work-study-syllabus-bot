 so the past and present are all kind of one here when we're talking about this the colonial past and Colonial presence that subtle colonialism is is bound up in this um you know in 1490 indigenous peoples were 20 of global population that Century later three percent um Global Colonial capitalism that's not a great concept but extractivism is a better one we'll deal with that and so the acquisition and commodification of these lands resource extraction settlement and imposition of rule but it's also the forgetting it's the it's the con it's the massive Reformation of these societies at the same time they're experiencing massive population loss forced resettlement all the rest of it so here's just a weird way to think about um some of the kind of precepts of forgetting when we're dealing with what settlement does not one ingredient in apple pie is indigenous to North America not the apples not the flower not the butter or lard not the cinnamon not the sugar nothing nutmeg I'm trying to um be honest about the origins of our food and through that by proxy being honest about the origins of this country so she's just talking about here at the Apple Pie as American as apple pie is every single aspect of of just you can just look up look up all of them look up the ways in which um land ingredients reshaping animal husbandry settlement uh farming are all bound up in this kind of remaking of of land right of taking the land and and reformat planting trees on it up and down the coast that then become the source of food a new food source that then becomes a a marker of American identity and so all of this weirdly enough indigenous lands are treated as as non-existent um the messed up part about reserves is that normally they were chosen because they were not farmable or not seen as as Prime Land part of the reason that they weren't farmable was because they probably had some other resource on it that was impeding the growth of that resource so as we found with apple water Scott Apple water Scout was this this um terrible uh um situation no drinking water lack of resources all sorts of uh crises Health crises that was taking place next to a de Beer's mine because um Apple water Scott also had a huge mining situation situation right next to it all of these reservations why we're having these land claim reservations is because it was assumed that the land wasn't worth anything so it was was literally deeded through constitutional right and treaty to these communities who now for example when we want to build our oil pipelines we have to put them through these very spaces and we're running into this problem there's no consent why would there be consent they're not necessarily getting the the benefits of these and so um you know reforming this is kind of basic stuff we don't need to deal too much with it but it's this continually unfolding process it's rooted in the dominant framework as I talked about before you know it's just in 2023 the Vatican finally rejects the doctrine of discovery um and then we have related issues that were still ongoing I mean still ongoing when it became clear that that residential schools um had grave sites all around them at first it was shocking and then it very obviously became clear that this was policy um in that the scale and scope was so outrageous and large because remember they were trying to kill the Indian and the child got lots of children's books on this too if you'd like to see them and so this is still a kind of way that we think about all of these different territories were were claimed under the idea that there was no prior state or prior sovereignty in the area so 1648 does matter in that it is a mutual recognition of equal sovereigns and so if you weren't in equal Sovereign by any mechanism those sovereigns could just literally take your territory so this is at this the access to territory is the difference between colonialism Etc colonialism primarily because colonialism is concerned with kind of domination of the existing population in order to produce um resources that get sent back whereas settler colonialism just like they want to land right um Federal power over uh Indians and lands reserved to Indians the settlement to the West the Americans have largely dealt with this they have extinguished the treaties they just unilaterally terminated them it's much harder to do because of the way that the constitution is structured and the 1763 Royal Proclamation we embedded in our constitution the treaties are an integral part of uh Canadian law and so we can't do those as easily and the dispossession of lands the the having like let's be clear if you're on a reserve you had to apply for a permit to leave the reserve to sell your goods off Reserve to the federal government in Ottawa right these reserves are all over the place in very remote regions and so it's just it's just Bonkers um Indian Act regulates every aspect of life like we talked about with the status thing that that's still ongoing it's still gone going mandated education through residential schools banned system of governments didn't establish and still we don't have established this day kind of democratic mechanisms on reserves for how they should be adjudicated I'm saying this from former students of mine who are indigenous who said like I still don't get to participate in a democracy because we don't have those but it's not at all clear that yeah whose values and what type of political order should be done and how it should be done there and just restricting indigenous participation in the settler economy is understating the extent to which um these The Taking of territory and then refusing to even allow you to sell the goods you make on The Reserve right stuff like that so it's it's all bound up in this so land is everything um uh land is everything because it's the foundation of all the the benefit right the the money the resources and so land back has become a persistent question here um so here's just one there's something that feels Canadian wow and what is the land back land back and so this is uh one of the the hashtags that's out at the moment this continues along tradition of establishing that there is this land was never um uh given away in many places it was illegally taken and that we have this push towards uh dealing with we'll deal with this in extractivism in the next video
