 so I just want to do a little bit of the theory of how we talk about um settler colonialism versus colonialism because it's just simply not in the text um settlement is a combination of conquest and migration um migrants moved into someone else's society and then the the settler or the colonial kind of makes it their own so it's this kind of idealization it's not the same as colonialism in part because it doesn't the it there's not an effort there's actually explicitly with the idea of reserves and the refusal to Grant voting to reserves for debt for well until the 70s right um that they don't use them to establish the foundation of their their governance right it's more about non-inclusion so settlement settler colonialism is more about the ability to just dispense or appropriate indigeneity and so unlike the idea of of the kind of mixing the land with your labor indigenous labor was both indispensable but then rejected over and over again and this idea then is is the land is the focus of settler colonialism we don't need to mix the labor of indigenous communities with the land because that's the thing that that we're after and so it comes over and over again um and so this settler part is key because it it explains the dynamic and the ongoing dynamics that this is a practice rather than a past experience so where we have postcolonialism and hybridity when we talk about the relationship of the The Saltwater Colonial experience here we need to talk about the ongoing Colonial practices right um it's this idea they want to derive the authority and then displace The Authority at the same time and so this is common to these settler colonial states in a way that's distinct from Colonial experiences it's this defensive project of the country against both building identity and so there's an absence of culture and identity but also about this appropriating the idea of the the way in which rule is happening happening this idea of establishing an identity where there wasn't one because you're eliminating the other framework so this is uh what what vuta calls the anglo-sphere there's a shared kind of anglospheric identity and so this for example is just one I want to show to talk about the ways in which it's not simply that we're creating identities Anew it's that we appropriate and and malleably change existing indigenous ways of being and then forget about where they came from so I just wanted to do a bit this is long but I want to do a bit about the offensiveness of how um that Mount Rushmore came about and that it's the six grandfathers and it was chosen specifically as a settler strategy which then becomes kind of lost to the way that we think a general like tedx but I mean this is a good quote right like one man's Shrine is another man's Cemetery like we really need to think about this and you know we've done a lot of Reckoning um especially um after black lives matter about kind of statues and the ways in which memorialization happens but this is this to me is just so messed up between 1927 and 1941 400 workers blasted 450 000 tons of rock from a Mountainside using chisels jackhammers and a lot of dynamite gradually they carved out Mount Rushmore now the monument draws nearly 3 million people to South Dakota's Black Hills every year its facade that lies a dark history about ten thousand years ago Native American people began inhabiting the Black Hills the area became especially sacred to the Lakota people who formed the Western Branch of what the U.S called the Sioux Nation the Lakota believed one came within the Black Hills to be where they first emerged and they named one of the Black Hills mountain peaks the six grandfathers after their sacred directional spirits but in the 1800s Lakota access to this land came under threat white settlers in North America expanded their territories by using physical violence or negotiating with indigenous peoples after its establishment in the late 1700s the U.S government ratified hundreds of treaties with Native American nations however it often broke them or created them using coercion between 1866 and 1868 the Lakota and their allies successfully defended their land from the U.S military and negotiated a new treaty with the government in the 1868 treaty at Fort Laramie all parties agreed that a vast territory including the Black Hills belong to the Sioux Nation in return the Lakota would allow U.S travelers to pass safe through but many aspects of the treaty also aimed to assimilate the Lakota into white culture this included incentives to convert them from hunting to farming abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and where clothes the U.S provided meanwhile just seven years later the U.S broke the treaty after an expedition found gold in the Black Hills miners set up camps the military attacked and ultimately defeated the Lakota and the U.S passed legislation illegally seizing the land 50 years later like it it's wild to me we'll talk about this but what is the law what the hell is a constitution you know and it's so many people like scream about certain parts of the First Amendment the Second Amendment all the rest of the Constitution but the ability to break your own laws and defend the law and use the law as a I guess it's a it's a political tool in these these mechanisms as a way of legitimating the existence of certain bodies and delegitimating the existence of others because it's you can't say you're following the law when you just you agree to a treaty you break the treaty you agree to another treaty you break the treaty right like it's so workers began etching into the lakota's sacred six grandfather's Mountain the project was led by an arrogant sculptor named Goodson Borglum who had ties to the KKK the historian originally proposed that Mount Rushmore include Western figures like Lakota Chief Red Cloud but Borglum chose to feature his own Heroes by October of 1941 Borglum had died from surgical complications and works stopped though the project was unfinished none of the four figures had torsos as intended and Rubble was left piled below to the Lakota the Monument was a desecration and the presidents immortalized on the rock face all had brutal anti-indigenous legacies members of the Iroquois Confederacy called George Washington Town Destroyer for encouragement I mean I have a whole Tick Tock about it but I didn't want to show it because it's just it and it's so heavy and and brutal um that like listen you absolutely look I can give you the links to it look it up but um it's hard like you'll shut it's hard to shut down learning when people feel emotionally weighted they should feel emotionally weighted but again that you won't learn if I do too much of it using military campaigns that burned 50 of their villages in 1779. Theodore Roosevelt championed forced assimilation and said I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead indians but I believe 9 out of ten are in 1980 after the Sioux Nation had sued the U.S for treaty violations the Supreme Court ruled that the Black Hills had been unlawfully taken and the suit were entitled to compensation the amount named has since reached over a billion dollars but the Sioux Nation refused to take the money and give up their claim to the Black Hills maintaining that they were never for sale so what should happen to Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills responses to that question are wide-ranging some including tribal leaders and borglum's great-granddaughter have called for Mount Rushmore to be removed others see it as an important patriotic symbol in vital aspect of South Dakota's economy that should remain many Lakota people want the 1868 treaty to be honored and the now federally controlled lands to be returned to their tribal communities others have said that the Lakota in the U.S should at least co-manage parts of the Black Hills currently there are no plans for change the U.S broke many of its promises with indigenous Nations making issues like this common native people have been fighting for broken treaties to be honored for Generations achieving some major victories along the way meanwhile if untouched the face is engraved on the sixth grandfather's Mountain are expected to remain for thousands of years to come so yeah it's the extent to scale the scope the um and we can do that there's so many things we can do this with I mean we had a football team that was named a racial slur and the biggest sport in America up till like 2020 and the only reason that it got changed was because they thought changing that would be a symbolic effort to deal with why black lives matter protesting started it just it's it's all symbolic hand waving it's very very weird anyways so that's set up a colonialism
