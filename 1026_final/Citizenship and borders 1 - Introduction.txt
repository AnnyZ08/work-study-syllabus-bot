 okay uh Welcome to our discussion on citizenship and borders um this is an interesting topic I always said that if I was going to redo my degree in political science I'd probably do migration studies or citizenship studies because it's so kind of integral to how we understand the very basic notion of the political and this goes back to what we've been talking about throughout the course of this Aristotelian and this notion coming from Greek and and um uh Athenian experience about who is a citizen and who who has rights and who is political and known and so it goes to the very question of what is political is dealing with citizenship and borders so this week we're going to deal with these Concepts and so we use these Concepts so much to kind of ingrained in us so it's hard for us to think them I'm going to try to avoid as much of the um kind of partisan emotional stuff around these issues because it's so heavily coded in ways of thinking about who we are and who we should be and all these identity issues and this is why it falls in the identity week but it also kind of problematizes those identities um for me what I was really surprised is that my fourth year students last year a couple of them wanted to deal with migration and their their Capstone project so we did a week on migration I went and found a couple books up-to-date books like an Oxford handbook on it and you know up-to-date books on these things um and I was surprised how critical they were citizenship studies in particular has moved very critically in ways that I don't think most people would be even aware of of how far they've moved and I was I was shocked myself so they're very it's very interesting but it rubs up against our sense of oh well that's the way we do things so we'll talk about um this relationship between citizenship and borders the origins of citizenship and and thinking about what it means and doesn't mean the rights associated with citizenship explain what formal citizenship is a bit talk about borders and borders will lead into the discussion for the next week when we start dealing with international relations so so we've dealt with ideas identity and then we're going to the international which I think is very into how this stuff has been structured right we always deal with these kind of local individual issues and then go right to the the UN or human rights issues or whatever we go to the top level we miss all the stuff that you're going to do in the second and the next term um it's it's this way in which we kind of divide up the discussion of the political um and then we'll talk about citizenship in a little bit when it comes to to covid um so I will say this [Music] um border issue is bigger than partisan issues and it generally involves claims and thinking that we're all embedded in it also is one where I mean you will have very strong opinions that don't amount to much like this so we have Kamala Harris saying in 2018 Trump's border walls absolute waste of taxpayer money I will not support it um Joe Biden says a border wall is physical embodiment of the inability to develop effective immigration policy and then the bite Administration gets elected and they continue to fund the border wall um this was very similar to um the problems of borders and how specific governments can't affect things that have to do with the state itself um so my example would always be Obama one of the first things he did when he got elected was sign a bill saying he was closing Guantanamo Bay Guantanamo Bay is still open to this day and so the idea then that just because you're in power you can change like the makeup of these things it's not very likely so it's more about ways in which you frame the issue or frame how these things work um so the textbook starts with a bunch of premises that I'm not entirely sure why um covid-19 pandemic was not the great equalizer predicted by The Who so I wrote a chapter on this and I went back and looked even back to Ebola and all the rest of it there were people yelling loud and clear the whole time um this liberal notion that somehow everybody is going to see a concept as objective and not contest it and politicize it and think about it and challenge it I don't know why we would ever think that it would be naively rational for people to just take radical change and and treat it as as uncontestable um so at best like I I did not think we would get a whole lot of it I thought maybe we get some Better Health Care maybe um especially Americans right you thought there would be some impetus for it but at certain points they were no like they wouldn't even you know do basic things that look too socialist so whatever um Health social and economic and political impacts of the pandemic were not experienced by everyone in the same way why would it be is it because it's seen as objective but like isn't everything experienced differently by different people if you've got access to resources things are going to be very different than if you don't right if you can sit in your your yacht off the coast um well all the stuff happens within the country you're going to experience things very differently it's always experienced differently um so this idea of you know closing the Border travel bans and debates on essential and non-essential workers so on one level yes the Border was closed for the public but I mean I couldn't find the data here but anyway I've seen it um basically like government relationships and high level politics and Elite politics still happened even when things were at the most closed um there were still exemptions for for government officers who need to be like top secret you know you're gonna still do intelligence still going to do those things um and so this idea then that that somehow um things weren't experienced hierarchically and are always doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's fine it's a naively optimistic claim I guess that somehow like that objective characteristics wouldn't would be objective um and I would also say that our framing of things like essential and non-essential workers is very loaded right so we know that yes absolutely um you know healthcare workers were at the front of it but we also know that like the teenagers working at the grocery store were at the front of it too they just weren't they were Frank as essential but not in a way that was really as such that we did clap for them as much I guess we did later but at the outset and um you know construction workers right and if you actually look at the number of people who were at work from home it was largely just you know that the the upper middle class who didn't have to like physically work in a physical space so my wife is a Horse Ride instructor she was alone she couldn't have anybody in but she was working the whole time you can't leave horses right like they would die right like you have to do that so there's always going to be workers working the problem is is that most of the people who write about these things think about these things and discuss these things are from a group that talk about everything their own experience as if it's a universe experience right and so the idea here is that it would prompt some discussion or conversations about citizenship and borders um but you know whether or not that's actually going to happen or how much it would happen would be up to um specific circumstances so there's been this long-standing discussion especially in Canada U.S is that for example when you buy something from the states when it comes across the border you might get hit with a Duty or some type of taxes or extra money that would count towards it and that is actually negotiated by the Canadian government because the Americans are like hey if we can sell more stuff to Canadians we'll absolutely just ship it across the border like get rid of that like let us dump in as much as we want I mean the Canadians like well no we have to protect Canadian businesses and by doing that we're actually charging Canadian consumers more so we're looking after the interests of Canadian businesses by making Canadians pay more through the Border like literally by putting the de minimis the amount that you can send without having to hit a Duty or fee as they want it as relatively low as possible where the Americans wanted as high as possible so one of the arguments has been is that if we actually want to have a beneficial trade relationship or a beneficial relationship is that why not give this goes along there was proposals to create a North American monetary Union like the EU and one of the things you do would create a common border like the EU like the Shenzhen Zone they have in Europe which would just be you have a perimeter security that the Americans police are on the outside and then you get free access to the Americans you can go over as much as day trips all the rest of it they they do the outside border you do the internal border and sort of function like the EU so the premise of course is that certain types of cooperation would be beneficial in borders in the way of that cooperation the problem of course is that what happened in the EU when we had the Syrian refugee crisis is that internal borders started popping up again is that we can always move back towards the idea that we should keep people out for whatever reason and then that would be how we would do it and so this idea somehow that that the great equalizer is a naive position based on a kind of lack of understanding of basic political precepts that people are going to contest any decision so thinking about citizenship and borders that is thinking about the ways in which we can it's all bound up in one another I'll talk about um the go specifically into citizenship in the next video
