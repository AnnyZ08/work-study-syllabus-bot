 so I just there's so many of these I mean everybody knows and can understand the issue with we know that it's important but we're struggling to see how it is political right and so let's roll it they asked me to do the land acknowledgment today land acknowledgments I find them so goddamn patronizing you want me to come up here with my feathers and my beads bless your little event tell you you're woke so I said to be delighted what do these land acknowledgments accomplish aside from making white people feel good about themselves I am going to convince you give your land back to the indigenous I swear to God you are first of all very funny second of all you're saying something that a lot of people obviously think right now needs to be said so let's get into this what's the back story behind how this developed we sold tickets to William Shakespeare's as you like it at crows theater and we opened on the Day of Reconciliation we were the only theater open after the pandemic and I come out and do the land acknowledgment and because it is the day of truth of reconciliation the land acknowledgment goes on a little long but I go on and I go on and I go on for 85 minutes and at the end of the show you don't get to see the show that you paid for you you've done a little bait and switch with people there we we did absolutely and everyone was thrilled but you've got it now that was the version that was you've done a new version now that that is just that's out there that's right we're not trying to fool anyone the pure the land acknowledgment we're at the CAA theater this month now when you did it the old way and people realized oh okay I get it I'm not here to see Shakespeare this is actually what it's about what was the reaction um they uh cheered and applauded also they sent nasty letters and and protested in the theater they yelled at me and stormed out we had a whole we had a real acknowledgment of the territory that we're on what'd you make of that reaction it always helps the show because any controversy people come together and they go wow either uh I I feel that way and I'm not going to see that show or I don't feel that way and I'm going to go down and see it so anytime okay anyways we get it uh the kind of performative nature of of what we're doing and how we're doing it and and this so all of this goes back to the UN drip in the recognition so the question is what does this recognition mean and how does it matter how is it political um so there are regions where no territories had been signed where these communities are consistently rebelling or fighting or or putting up challenges to the idea of of this extractivism and so there's this the James Bay and the Northern Quebec agreement in 1975 and The Calder Clays in 73 led to Modern land claims agreement um idea of extinguishing indigenous title in exchange for self-government these really intensified as I showed earlier with Harper between 2006 and 2015. this idea in part because um given the high price of oil and the fact that bitumen development had really come a long way Canada all of a sudden has this this resource this capacity that it wants to be able to utilize in order to provide benefit now how that benefit gets distributed and how that resource gets to Market is the central question because for the existence of Canadian energy production has always been bifurcated between the West and East Coast it's always been dependent on traveling to the U.S for refining because we don't have refining capacity we can extract it but we can't refine it so it has to go to the U.S or it has to go abroad it has to hit the coasts and so in order to hit the coast in these pipelines in order to do pipelines it has to go across many territories and that's always been a problem so this intensification on a maximization of resource extraction creates these these issues both in terms of environmental regulations and the idea that extractivism is okay in 2012 we have this Omnibus Bill that tries to deal with this by revoking all sorts of Environmental Protections narrowing the scope of environmental assessments changing trying to change the Indian Act to lease out Reserve lands to allow extraction no indigenous consultation at all and so the Idle No More came about so it was all this data doesn't matter it's just the idea that you're violating treaty rights with these bills this was a unilateral decision um it it reduced the threshold for surrender of these Reserve lands changes the navigable Water Act tried to remove forms the Education Act to remove the ability of bands to pass bylaws removes the Supreme Court's recognition of matrimonial law allows um non-indigenous to own land on reserves and pose election codes including jail and fines removes computer so it does everything opposite of the UN drip um and so this idea of the UN drip is establishing rights is always this tension between uh we might have the rights but the enforcement of the right still falls on the nation state so what we do get is recognition without this underlying effort to resolve um I pulled this just when the most recent one this is just from the government's website um the Perpetual problem is that many of these communities that don't have infrastructure resources lack things like basic drinking water so we remove Environmental Protections which would demand that you have to have basic drinking water because they've been contaminated with runoff or production or mining or whatever it is that you uses huge amounts of water in order to extract these resources and then those become the thing that result in these communities that don't have developed infrastructure because their reserves and they're often in remote areas because that's where we designated reserves have had long-term uh drinking water advisors that don't have access to clean drinking water and so recognition then is the way to kind of move towards this without actually dealing with the underlying issues the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation committee the implementation of undripped it's really been limited self-government and more delivery there's been some BC is is experimenting with indigenous Healthcare there's lots of different ways that you know I mean BC's seen lots of development actual development on indigenous lands by indigenous um you know Innovation businesses is all the rest of that that's been happening but this idea of full self-determination is still this problem the idea of the Constitution still dictating how we think about these treaty rights the duty to be consulted and accommodated the consultation then what does consultation mean like we're telling you we're going to do this or it doesn't involve a process how is consent achieved and who is it can achieved by is it by the leader in a non-democratic band is it by the Elders of that community and so there's been Lots especially what's sweating lots of debates about who actually gave us Authority and then if there is no consent the government can still act with justification so you know what I mean like if they're still going to act they're still going to act that's the long history of governments agreeing to things and just doing whatever the realities of the experiences on the the ground are are things like lack of access to water and this I've got some I literally have an entire slide deck of just images and memes of the prices of things in in Arctic communities which we haven't even touched on a little bit but Arctic communities face fundamentally different issues of service provision of responsibilities of all the rest of it and then basic things like the cost of food so here's just Tick Tock talking about it recent earthquake look at the brown sugar 17 for partisan Rock brown sugar 40 bucks for bacon buffalo chicken strips of chicken noodles 9.59 there's nothing in there Frozen fruits garbage bags bag liners twenty dollars for burritos 27 for ice cream so the idea here is that the experiences of indigenous communities today right now go on Tick Tock it's called native Tick Tock you can look it up they're all there um talking about the actual experience of indigenous communities is far removed from this idea that we're working towards reconciliation or that we're actually improving the ways in which we do it what we're doing now is just kind of recognizing that we establish these treaties but we're not actually looking at the treaties in terms of what are we supposed to have done and so um Canadian law is much more limited than un drip they should have the right to protection against Integrity right to develop their legal systems fully participate in the cultural life of the state I don't know how you can fully participate when you're paying those prices for food this idea of free prior informed consent means that it should be approved prior to but the Supreme Court has simply not went that way so the lack of meaningful consultation remains an issue it's going to continually be an issue these conflicts are going to be Perpetual issues and it raises these questions about how things that we've agreed to are going to be established and so they just picked this the textbook pixes it's fine the trans pipeline extension it's trying to get the the bitumen to the Pacific coast so there can be ships places to be refined right because we don't have a refining capacity um and so it threatens Wildlife waterways potentially let's be clear all systems fail as soon as you know the any of these pipelines get set up there is going to be a certain level of seepage and spillage it's indefitable the question is to what extent is that part of extractivism and therefore a necessary risk in order to get the reward or is it just a fundamentally no-go we don't believe that we should be doing putting any more money into oil gas exploration and development right um consent wasn't given there's all sorts of resistance and the government is you know purchasing the pipeline using the RCMP to enforce pipelines stopping protests all the rest of this as I showed and so the idea here is that this slow moving process is an ongoing process it's things that exist in reality and that if we're talking about identity I'm not sure we're talking about actual experiences of indigenous identity we're talking about how does settler States come to terms with the existence of indigenous communities that have always been and will always be alongside these mechanisms by which resources are extracted
