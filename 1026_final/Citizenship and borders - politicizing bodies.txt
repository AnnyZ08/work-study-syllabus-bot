 so I assume this will have to be a Dropbox video because we're going to get a copyright strike for this but um this is the textbook video It's actually kind of interesting what do we know what's happening right now there's been some condemnation including from the Arab League president erdogan seems to be pushing back right it's uh really the second full day of uh of turkey's incursion into Northern Syria and uh it's that's really generated International condemnation of the move and there's even a closed-door U.N security Council meeting going on about that about that incursion right now president erdogan has pushed back very strongly he said uh in a basically a threat to Europe that if uh if the criticism doesn't tone down he's willing to open the floodgates he says to millions of Syrian refugees who have resettled in Turkey saying he'll push them into Europe and uh as you remember when that last happened at the at the early days so this is the way in which borders and migration then become kind of tools or weapons of statecraft so States use bodies as threats this is by no means new we have now generations of Palestinians throughout the region who have lived their entire lives and their parents have lived their entire lives outside of the place of which they're supposed to have citizenship right because it's not a state and so I I haven't got to yet at some point we'll get to Israel Palestine but um yeah I'll use it as an example at some point but the interesting part here is is not about the ways in which we can get into that that whole the interesting part is the surrounding regions are using Palestinians Refugee status as an ongoing form of weaponization against Israel and there's a bunch of studies on this as a source of revenue for them so places like Jordan have a huge Palestinian population they could have just converted them into jordanians and allowed them to have dual status but it makes more sense to have this sense of outrage that then fuels money that goes to those communities to support them so you don't have to so there is this strategic weaponization of bodies that belong or don't belong against other states as strategies of like State craft and warfare so we'll get to this next week when we start dealing with international relations but I'll let them finish days of the Syrian Civil War that resulted in big political uh earthquake across the continent uh undermined Chancellor merkel's government it shook up politics in the UK so erdogan is trying to use uh whatever leverage he has to remember it was the securitization of the idea of the influx of migrants that led the bus going around just with fake news going around claiming that that um the EU is going to force the Brits to take on more migrants was one of the reasons they went with brexit so it's a strategic weapon this is also I don't like getting into it too much because you get into these weird kind of gross using of people for political ends push back on what's been a widely condemned move into Syria so as you suggest that threat from president erdogan struck me at least as a potential Doomsday Machine for Europe if they really released millions of refugees into Europe is there anything Doomsday Machine people effectively constraining president erdogan right now president Trump says he could wreck his economy if he went too far I think it's more Bluster and uh than reality uh in terms of what this threat is President Trump has repeatedly said he has a lot of sanctions levers at his disposal and remember turkey is still a NATO member it still craves the uh still craves that uh role so this is super complicated too because the Kurds are one of those groups that just never got statehood um and given that we have States now and they're not reproductive they don't see any way to give statehood to groups without giving up their statehood so this is the problem of secession movements and this idea that Kurds and Kurdistan is this political project that undermines and threatens the National Security in their mind of turkey has as the second biggest military in NATO and obviously angering most of your European Partners is not the way to to remain in that kind of Alliance so I think he's frustrated with uh with the criticism his move is generated but I don't think we're close to seeing refugees pushed into Europe at this point what do we know what's happening so it's just this kind of the ways in which states political politicized and and weaponize um these issues I will see how it goes um in terms of this course in general this this question should non-citizens who live in Canada such as migrant workers and international students be granted all the same rights Canadian Nationals where why not uh I I'm not super comfortable with that I mean you I mean we can do what we want it's just it the question is framed in such a way as like do you or do you have your human rights or not because you're not from here you don't uh can you imagine the idea of being able to say I'm from here so therefore I get to decide whether or not you are a human at equal human in terms of Rights and responsibilities right I guess that's what we do it just when you frame it differently it becomes very weird how comfortable we are making such claims and how immediately we are well yeah because we have to because we can't just have the radical social change that comes from set all their societies can't have the radical social change that they know comes from settlement of a mass population that pushes out the previously existing population oh man okay I gotta end it there because I can't do better than that
