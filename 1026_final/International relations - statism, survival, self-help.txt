 okay so um yeah approaches these theories some people call them myths um uh I when I'm teaching the second year international relations course I call them myths because that's what Cynthia Weber calls them um some people call them stories some people call them theories they're just a series of debates between people who say they have a better framework for explaining what's happening at the international level um these debates revolve around three separate kind of let's say schools um realism is one so realism I mean this isn't actually telling a good story realism emerges as a critique of idealism as this perceived notion that using these ideal approaches that we use at the domestic level when we talk about Theory don't function internationally so it's a criticism of ideas liberalism says that actually the evidence of international the International System is largely moving towards more cooperation therefore we can see cooperation in institutions as the main thing that explains the world and this Marxist approach which isn't explained well but I'll kind of bring in some examples is to see the system as a coherent whole in which way in which case like if someone's uh benefiting it's normally at the expense of someone else or the idea that conflict is inherent to the system it's not outside the system liberalism doesn't have an endogenous theory of violence it doesn't believe that that violence comes from Liberal Frameworks realism believes that the whole system is always headed towards violence violence is the natural outcome of this system um and we'll talk about why that's the case and then these three Challengers is what we'll get into okay so this is this is from Weber she says that these are these starting assumptions of realism which are much more complex than this because it's the dominant approach in the U.S so there are thousands of people doing this type of work all the way back to Henry Kissinger which we can have questions about what happens when you adopt this stuff in actual policy terms part of the Hitchens case against Henry Kissinger calling him a war criminal was that he adopted these approaches in his application of policy and to this day and still insists um that that he was right in doing it um he can't travel certain countries in the world for fear of prosecution but that's a separate Point okay so the international Anarchy myth um is basically just this back to our 1648 discussion International politics is composed of Sovereign Nation States there is no world government which means there was no International orderer um there isn't so um at best the United Nations even when we're talking about something like the universal Declaration of Human Rights we can declare that human rights it is um largely aspirational as a document it does not require anything specific of states it just insists that states should follow the principles of it and they are it's up to individual states to implement those things so statehood is embedded in the U.N which means it is not a world government because there's no higher authority everything that happens at the U.N is with the consent of decisions made by States um and so the absence of this world order uh world orderer or World Government means that International politics is by definition anarchical and not this doesn't mean disorder back to our discussion Anarchy right it doesn't mean chaos it just means there's no higher authority to tell any individual State what to do right that's how um it functions it's just the absence of a higher authority and so this is in in its basic form statism we're going to talk about what the International System is we have to talk about nation states they are the thing those 193 of them that's what it is and we're not creating more at a rate of speed that would make them significant and everybody wants to have them and they fight over the control of them right that's what we do and so um the three aspects of realism this is a good way that the 3s is to remember them statism survival and self-help so the state is the preeminent actor in terms of this kind of realist approach to international relations the struggle for power between different states is the goal of the system right um you know where States want to achieve their political will and so they can do it with Force but they can also do it with an election interference right you can make sure that people who get elected are sympathetic to your cause or you've donated to them so that they um they are beholden to you right um these type of things and so you can understand the problem like at nation state wants to say don't interfere in my Affairs but you have to stop them from doing a sovereign state has to exercise its sovereignty and if it doesn't then the rest of the system can kind of there's nobody telling them they can they agreed to when they signed the U.N that you're not supposed to interfere in the Affairs of other states but that's generally just an agreement and I mean you're not supposed to declare war because that might actually upset the other states but as far as election interference goes it's kind of up to the state to stop it from happening right um because you're all Sovereign like you want to interfere in somebody else's election they've got to stop you it's this problem there's nobody telling you not to do it right they're telling you you shouldn't do it and you agreed to not do it but you agreeing to something isn't the same as a government telling you if you do it this will happen right okay and so um all of these national interests come in different forms they can come in terms of trying to achieve the most wealth resources capabilities or military power nation states are perceived of as pursuing rationality so this is another theory of the system um we can say that there are irrational actors but even irrational actors are perceived of through their actions as acting rationally so even if we don't agree with the North Korean system at all and we know they've got nuclear weapons they have not and will not fire one of those nuclear weapons at the U.S this is the underlying Assumption of this system right that that they recognize no matter how different they are they recognize that their actions will be perceived by others and they will be responsible for the actions that happen and so there is rationality in the system even for actors that are perceived of as irrational now remember this is just for nation states and so as a consequence of this then there is no Central Authority and so states are always going to try to maximize in this framework in this myth they're always going to try to maximize their personal benefit and so um there's a bunch of different uh controversies that we can't get into and actually they're not that interesting about why this stuff happens famously Walt says you know the cause of war is found in the nature and behavior of man okay let's let's run with that it's it's gendered but in a way that okay War results from selfishness miscorrect misdirected aggressive impulses from stupidity if these are the causes of War then the elimination of war must come through uplifting and enlightening men are securing their social um psycho psychic social Readjustment okay yes uh yeah there's problems in masculinity and that that's uh indicating it but it's there's also problems here with the idea that states reflect individual selfishness and that individual selfishness because we can treat States as unitary actors are also selfish um this is largely a behaviorist tradition so we are extrapolating State action from the behavior of people it has been since the 70s largely fallen out of favor for the idea it's just the structural Anarchy um even Canada is going to try to maximize it and it may believe all the values of the world in the world but it's still going to try to maximize its interest when it goes into a trade negotiation with the US so it doesn't matter what your values and our ideals are you are going to pursue your self-interest and so you do this because you want to survive because there is uh survival is not guaranteed under a system of Anarchy no one and this is the the survival and self-help is no one's going to help you because everybody's literally their own thing um and so it's a zero sum and this isn't 100 true but this is a zero-sum framework where if you get um benefit if you get more if you have more power capability resources it comes at the expense of another um so this can be in absolute or relative terms right so just because you have acquired a nuclear weapon that may put you ahead of all the other states that don't have one but if you only have one and the US has 50 it's still going to be a relative thing and so this idea is that there is a competition to survive and this is always going to stem from selfishness now I apologize for the whiteness of this video hopefully it doesn't get copyright blocked but this is a classic stupid argument I asked chechi PT for all of the examples in this video that is an appropriate use of chat GPT brainstorming ideas perfectly fine seven of the eight ideas on any of these videos were bad so just because you're brainstorming and just because you've got somebody else doesn't mean they're good ideas anyways this is a video talking about the idea of selfishness sorry thieves I just you know I just wanted to do a good deed like like you did with the babies this isn't a good deed you what about you having those babies for your brother talk about selfish thing about well yeah it was a really nice thing and all but it made you feel really good right yeah so well it made you feel good so that makes it selfish look there's no unselfish Good Deed sorry considered selfless well may I ask for one example yeah it's you know there's no you may not that's because all people are selfish are you calling me selfish are you calling you people yeah sorry to burst that bubble thieves but selfless Good Deeds don't exist okay and you know the deal on Santa Claus right find a selfless Good Deed I'm gonna beat you you Evil Genius okay I don't think I need to go through the whole video but the underlying premise here is just that um there is an argument that there is no such thing as a selfless act that everything is selfish it's an argument it's not a particularly good one because you know we reproduce and socially care for one another and we do so even for animals and things that we don't necessarily have an immediate interest if the idea of benefit is selfish then we then I don't know what what love is because then love would just be perceived of as selfish which it totally could be um but this reductive it's very reductive so the oversimplification excessively oversimplifies right it makes everything into one framework regardless of what happens and so this idea of of self-interest or self-help um is a a oversimplified understanding of the Anarchy of each state relying on its own power and so the absence of a global Sovereign creates the 911 problem this idea that nobody intervened in Afghanistan early enough to stop 911. maybe um you know 911 was non-state actors as well so this Theory actually doesn't have a whole lot to say and then we'll get to this in the constructivist stuff part of the constructivist critique of this framework is that it if states are everything then you can't really explain terrorism and you can't really explain anything that's not a state right and it's a long history of humans haven't been in States so it doesn't make a ton of sense um but these security dilemmas are increased as each state seeks to increase its power so one of the perceptions was is that Libya was too belligerent and therefore NATO had to intervene right they were acting in their own self-interest but their self-interest threatened the self-interest of others and when they bind together they intervene to do that and so this is the idea of keeping a balance of power States band together to keep others in check because they are self-interested in Collective or aggrandizing power into institutions or ways of doing things and so NATO is one of the example but during the the Cold War we also had the Warsaw Pact right that the Soviets saw this as well and said listen we have to have a Soviet Union to counter this perceived ways in which the the West Was mobilizing themselves so the question and there is no answer to this question and we go through this debate every 10 years in international relations about which system is best so is it best to have a system where there's a single strong actor this is really the end of World War II when the U.S is willing to subsidize the creation of the UN to rebuild all of the the economies after the war and guarantee the International System so we see that as a largely unipolar system but almost immediately the Soviet Union rising up creates a bipolar system and the Cold War then between the Soviet unions and the west or the Americans was seen as relatively stable in terms of expressions of global conflict right um that there were wasn't a lot of incentives for states to try to challenge the supremacy of those two and in fact a lot of developing nations took advantage of this and played both sides right so I'll do something for you you give me something I'll do something for you you give me something um but it reinforces state power which is to say that a lot of those people playing both sides were dictators or terrible regimes or would do stuff and we didn't intervene because they were an ally and so this idea of a bipolar system has some benefits for stability has a lot of um problems as well but the multi-polar system is generally agreed to be it might be the most democratic like when we talk about democracy but it's also the most unstable because when you're constantly trying to one-up one another each other and gain power and relative power and influence you can do things and and utilize the system against itself so for example without a single hegemonic actor it certainly makes sense for Russia to counter what it sees as you know NATO by intervening in Ukraine and saying that we are just in waging this war and the West says no you're not just in waging this war but we don't have anybody to adjudicate that dispute because they're both sitting members of the United Nations and they can veto one another that we'll talk about in a minute there isn't any framework to deal with this so we end up with a multi-polar system that doesn't seem like it can respond to these these these problems it's not like the past that said the bipolar system produced multiple interventions on both sides in Afghanistan that led to the situation that led to 9 11 that led to the reintervention then led to them leaving again so if if you've the history of Afghanistan is not one of stability based on the bipolar system and so realism then is just this idea that the system of Anarchy is going to produce self-help and this this sovereignty and self-help Notions are the ways in which we can these three sovereignty selfishness and self-help right survival and self-help are the ways in which we can frame the realist intervention
