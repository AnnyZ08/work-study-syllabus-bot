 apologies that last video went um too long um you know it said I get excited about these things so this is the problem right and you get excited and well we'll see um so clearly there's a strong relationship between the border and the citizen right it's which side of a border you you were born into is what just determines your status and so that becomes integral um so this is very much tied to the westphalian understanding of the The Sovereign Nation State the ways in which um that bounding of the territorial status is what makes your citizenship yours um in that you can establish that you were born somewhere that's what gives you the status right hopefully um and so if the state exercises uh sovereignty over given uh territory it's also the population on that territory assuming that population registers with that state if you're not in that Yugoslavian situation where the state falls apart and you don't register with the right thing nobody knows who you are there was a worry for the time in the case of Brazil that the lavalasta the slums um the levellas the the there was babies being born who never encountered the state so we didn't actually have any record of them um you have to hope that your state has good record keeping in order to do this and we'll come back to the board why that matters so much for borders in a minute um and so borders are identified on maps as fixed as static has taken for granted but in reality they are very fluid porous political um you know like this idea perimeter security or the EU can set up new mechanisms where everybody gets to travel freely and then the other they can come back up again and close again conflict so if we decide we are shutting off relations with the country you can no longer get access to Iran or Russia this happens all the time and so colonialism imperialism War conflict and political settlements all Impact Through Your Capacity to access the Border borders nothing States love more than playing with fighting and defending borders um and so the problem of course is communities don't live there and territories live across them and the Heart understanding have long been there before the Border existed there's all sorts of I could put them in here they're so nerdy I can't even do them but lots of um there's a um a dude on Tick Tock that does nothing but talk about weird borders and how these weird relationships or decisions made one of the problems in particular with with this border was that it was made during one of the settlements I want to say either the War of 1812 or one of the piece of the Treaty of Versailles um set the the Canada U.S border that didn't that just like put it as a line and that actually doesn't follow the territory um accurately and so it created all of these problems that exist to this day because we put a line on our map in the wrong spot right um and so in particular for the the Mohawk territory um this idea of it being bisected uh impacts their ability to cross the border and that they have their status cards um are supposed to under treaty give them access to their territory but try to tell that to an 18 year old Border guard who just got the job and doesn't understand the long complex history of cellular colonialism right and they're they're under the idea that people are trying to get in and we got to stop it right so then it creates this problem so what we really have is something like a nested sovereignty or more complex understanding of these relationships about who is where I think the argument being made in the textbook here is that like the idea of these places as traditionally part of Mexico that were lost by territory boundary dispute or let's be clear in many cases settlers illegally settling and then the state being like I guess I guess that's ours now right like that's why British Columbia has this problem of unseated territory because it's like it was settled but it's not necessarily legal per se and so southern states are inherently in between they have these foreign legacies of culture they're desperate to establish an identity and they're constantly refounding this identity this overcompensation that's what I think like you know there are absolutely border disputes all throughout Europe but there's also European identity right I don't know what a North American identity is I I know the dominant settler identity is something akin to sports and beer maybe and flag waving I guess but in practice the culture there doesn't have a deep and established tradition that we would call ethnicity right um there is no singular Canadian identity um you can try they desperately want to create an American identity but their fear their constant fear about like the loss of their property back to lock has to do with the ways in which that citizenship is bound up and they know full well that they're settled on that territory and how dare you have the right to do anything so I saw you know who knows I saw meme online or whatever but and this real increasing thing that in the States you don't ring doorbells anymore because people now are so fearful of something coming to take their property that they're willing to shoot first when you ring a doorbell which is an overcompensation for a lack of culture that feels secure in its cultural identity it doesn't have to care so much about being invaded right um and so in the classic political thought then foreignness generally is is taken to signify the threat of corruption it must be kept out or contained for the sake of the stability of the regime and so all of our development of of foreignness or protections against foreignness or about the proper level of migration has to do with I mean I don't know but we have a long history of um uh Chinese population Chinese speakers in Canada um my sister-in-law it has um my niece she's speaking uh Cantonese um we have this tradition so why not just you know let a greater number of Chinese population gets citizenship as Canadians and you'll see immediately how much well it's disruptive to whatever because it's not like ours or whatever I mean there was all sorts of this stuff when um the money first got out in China and the Chinese population which has basically been a feudal population all of a sudden was middle class and started traveling all over the world you see signs up in India in New York about like what's proper behavior because they'd never encountered the rest of the world they went from from not having this experience of a passport and the ability to travel to fully traveling and that it creates all of these culture clashes about you know what are you supposed to do they've got all these signs you know at buffets right like westerners don't waste your food at a buffet right like you're just wasting food for no reason these types of attitudes and opinions result in culture clashes so one of the problems of course is that we know that the West has and this is across the board declining birth rates these are the 2021 uh it's too small to see here but like almost every country including some other ones have declining birth rates this is the other problem is that we are aging rapidly so this is just Europe but you can see how quickly the ages are shooting up it's even worse in places like Korea and Japan so for example in Korea and there will be uh nine seniors for every 10 working um in a place like South Africa there are 10 working for every two elderly or seniors so we have problems of providing those social goods and we have this situation where we have more and more migrants without citizenship so Qatar is number two on there the UAE is number one so we have solutions to these problems and just nobody wants to deal with them because they have to deal with the foreignness problem is that we have these these migrants you know 272 million migrants migrants doesn't confer citizenship it just talks about movement right so you can work there you can have a status it don't necessarily have full citizenship um and that is and again there's three percent we have eight billion people on the planet that's not very much Mobility right um and so we have this idea of migration or migration that happens in ways we don't like so there are flows that we're not expecting or there's more of it but we also know that migration would fix these problems we have in our systems it's just nobody's willing to do the math even though everybody's doing the math right we don't have enough people who here are young to pay for these Social Security Programs for an increasingly uh older population as they get older we all age we are going to need more young people there are lots of young people all throughout the world in situations that if we were granting them status they could help each other mutually because in the growth economy we have no set boundary on how big economies can get we just don't want to have those questions because of the ways that we think about citizenship the idea that um the the destinations um are not really here as much anymore because of the the ranking and those all of those things um that we have these populations that are moving because they don't have access to those resources in those other economies um and then we have this perception that it creates new problems because the opinions and ideas that come with those people aren't ones that we think that we have here right now and so we've seen this idea that there's certain places that have higher amounts of migration and certain places that have less but they're certainly not at levels to sustain the Western um population declines right um and so whatever we have this global migration it's increased politicization and forced debates on management regulation of borders it's sure countries are selectively opening and closing borders based on groups and there's Vickers and Isaac states make race um desirability of the migrant it's kind of gross right like this Global race for talent will do it in both ways um states make race and they have Longley the what Vickers and I argue is that the the long history of North American and particularly settlerless Society so Australia and uh New Zealand Australia New Zealand Canada and the US have wanted to maintain like an 80 white population explicitly framed in terms of race right um and that they don't like upsetting that number because it seems to be politically unstable because um when you have privilege equality seems like oppression I don't know what to tell you that um and so this idea then of of work experience language ability and education is the West selectively brain draining these other countries but not at a rate of speed that's making substantive inroads against the loss of population growth and the age problem and so we can see this right so that we have all of these these people coming to to to immigrate here um but the permanent and non-permanent immigration is 80 of our population growth right so the only reason that we're growing is because of migration and yet we make it difficult or we use things like temporary work permits or this idea of establishing permanent residence or refugees still a tiny number there and that this but it becomes this point of moral Panic we have whole political parties that create their entire campaigns around the threats of migration framing these issues okay I'll stop there in case because otherwise I'll go on for 30 minutes again but that's just this idea of of thinking about the ways in which we should be dealing with these this foreignness issue but we we can't because of the ways that we feel about this you don't want to suddenly be uh I was going to say you don't want to be the only one in your community that's not speaking Mandarin so therefore you won't open your borders to a population that could fully fill up our social safety networks I I don't know what else to tell you I wish we could we could frame it some other way anyways I'll stop there
