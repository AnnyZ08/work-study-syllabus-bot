 so this is the video from the um how do you define from the textbook um again they just took it from crash course but I'm not going to show the whole thing I'll just show a bit of it um which covers the same material as before again the absent subject position probably should be foregrounded a bit more clearly the race if you had to describe why you think you're a member of One race and someone else was a member of a different one you'd probably focus on appearances your skin your hair maybe even the structures of your bodies and faces but most of the time those physical criteria mean different things depending on the culture you're a part of an obvious example is skin color we use the word white and black to describe two races but the distinction in skin color between those races isn't as clear-cut a white person listen white people aren't white like look at me on some shade of pink and you know there's this if you there's been lots of art installations that have shown that like it's some type of beige and there's melanin differences and they change throughout your life and lighting matters and I just changed my lighting source and now it looks differently so again you can try to do this but I I think it's slippery then who spent the summer at the beach might come home with brown skin but getting a tan doesn't change their race and light-skinned black people may have skin that's not all that darker than that tan clearly race is about more than just the literal color of someone's skin so let's talk about race and why it's a topic that goes more than Skin Deep [Music] much like gender race is a socially constructed category in this case it's used to categorize people who share biological traits that a society thinks are important so you might be wondering wait what oh man Americans have messed up views on Race I'm worried it's sociologically too they don't do the politics properly I'm not sure about this I'll let it continue but I'm not sure how can race be both a social construct and something based on biology well the key part part of that definition of race is the last part what a society thinks is important sure skin color varies widely across regions of the world but so does eye color and we don't consider people with blue eyes A different race than people with brown eyes and while physical traits are often used to describe or identify a race they're not always applied consistently take for example the so-called one drop rule in the United States where even the smallest amount of African-American ancestry is enough to classify someone as black rather than white the opposite however isn't true someone with one black parent and one white parent is almost never considered white plus people from different places or different time periods have defined racial groups differently nowadays light-skinned people of European descent are typically considered white in the United States it doesn't matter whether your heritage is British or Irish or Italian or polish or German you're just white but that wasn't the case a century ago in the early 1900s anyone who wasn't white Anglo-Saxon Protestant was considered ethnic so for example if you were Italian or Irish you weren't considered white likewise today being Jewish is often the Protestant part right the Catholic part um it's still you know this long history with um like she said the Irish and the Italians but also like Jewish and all the rest of it so again it's so slippery seen as an ethnicity in the United States but Europeans are more likely to think of being Jewish As a Race So that raises the question what's the difference between ethnicity and race well ethnicities are socially constructed categories based on cultural traits that a society finds important rather than strictly biological traits essentially an ethnic group is a group that has a shared cultural heritage language Traditions religion these are all types but does it go in reverse does any group that shares a cultural heritage become an ethnic group this is what I mean these categories are so like furries they have a culture that they share do we consider them an ethnic group like I I sociology likes categorizing which is why I'm a bit more hesitant to use it than at least the evidence-based well I mean anthropology is sociology one is interested in exploring culture one is interesting classifying culture I would say I don't know whatever it's a culture that can determine your ethnic background two people of different races might share an ethnicity and conversely to people of the same race might be of totally different ethnicities Japanese and Vietnamese people are both considered Asian but they come from different cultural backgrounds in fact a term that many people think refers to race Hispanic actually refers to ethnicity to explore this a little more let's go to the thought bubble to talk about the difference between the terms Hispanic Latino and Latin American the term do we ossify these categories do we reinforce them by so wanting to nail them down as if they mean one thing I just I wonder about the monovocality of this like speaking with a single voice right versus multiple voices anyways Hispanic first appeared as a racial category in the U.S census in 1970 as a way of describing those whose Heritage originated in a Spanish-speaking country before then the census referred to those people as Spanish Americans even though tracing back their Origins to Spain would mean going away way back for many of them and for others it'd be totally inaccurate but in day-to-day conversation most people from Spanish-speaking backgrounds were usually referred to by the country of their Heritage like Mexican-American or Cuban American or sometimes more broadly as Latin American this lasts well because there's a big difference between Mexico and Cuba right like even within those communities they have different dialects different Expressions different ways of of articulating and seeing things one form of speaking isn't the same is another I don't know like this seems like it's from the top down I I don't I don't know the value of this let's get it this term is also where we get the word Latino and the degendered latinx it's a shorter version of the Spanish word Latino Americano and it refers to someone whose Heritage originates from nations in the Americas that are south of the United States including Mexico all of South America and the Caribbean now not all think about these definitions of what they're doing in terms of understanding like I don't have any source for that I don't know where it comes from and I know that these are contested all over the place but like we want one I guess so we feel that we have a good understanding of those communities and if we understand those communities we can speak authoritatively about them I don't know this is I mean everything rubs me the wrong way but this is really really wrong Hispanics are Latino being from Spain for example makes you Hispanic but not Latino and not all Latinos are Hispanic Brazilians speak Portuguese meaning that they are not considered Hispanic but regardless of which term you're using Hispanic or Latino either of these distinctions are based on physical appearance unlike race which is based on observable physical traits ethnicities aren't and in fact okay and I don't know that that's two people of the same ethnicity can be entirely different races for example both Cameron Diaz and Rosario Dawson are Cuban Americans which means they are both Hispanic but Cameron Diaz is white and Rosario Dawson is black thanks thought bubble though race is more commonly used by society as a way to organize people and distribute power both race and ethnicity play a role in how people are perceived and therefore the opportunities that are available to them a person's race influences a whole host of social outcomes from their education to their income to their experiences with the criminal justice system but which races or ethnicities are advantaged or disadvantaged depends on when and where we're talking about for example in the United Kingdom so are they not including whiteness in this discussion then I mean I'm okay with with framing it as a as a non-existent phenotypical characteristic or whatever characteristic that you want to frame it as but I feel like it's an absent subject position again I I don't know there's been a lot of unrest about immigration from Eastern Europe especially Poland dility and violence against polish immigrants increased in the wake of the UK's exit from the European Union but while Eastern Europeans are considered an ethnic minority in the UK people in the U.S are much more likely to think of Eastern European immigrants as just white they're not thought of as a minority and that's because what constitutes a minority is more complex than you might think sociologists Define a minority as any category of people who are distinguished by physical or cultural differences isn't that just defined like I don't understand Society sets apart and subordinates this is the danger of doing interdisciplinary work is that the assumptions of one discipline come from a specific set of experiences but in political side we don't like definitions we don't like definitions because we think everything is contested so it doesn't make sense to just like throw around definitions like this now notice that does that share a distinctive identity based on physical or cultural traits second minorities occupy a lower status in society and have less access to the levers of societal power notice how that definition doesn't say anything about the size of the group in sociology a minority group's relative size isn't important for example women are considered a minority even though they make up about 51 percent of the United States and a group that's a minority in terms of size can still be a majority in terms of power South African apartheid is an example of this from 1948 to 1994. Pixar's Africa apartheid okay skirt skirt the politics or a white minority maintained a system of racial segregation and discrimination against black South Africans right now non-hispanic whites are the majority group in the United States in terms of sheer size making up 61 percent of the US population but that's I don't like the way she said weights I tend to not use it I tend to use it as a category put upon people but I don't like appropriating it rapidly changing as of 2015 babies of color being born now outnumber non-hispanic white babies and five states are already minority majority States California Texas New Mexico Nevada and Hawaii how can a state or country be minority majority isn't that like an oxymoron well for one thing even if non-hispanic white Americans no longer make up more than half of the country they'll likely remain a larger group than any other single race but also to be a minority in the sociological sense of the word a group must be in a position of disadvantage and as we've discussed many times before non-hispanic white Americans tend to have higher incomes live in better neighborhoods and are more likely to have more prestigious jobs and better educations than racial and ethnic minorities but before we can make comparisons between different racial groups in the U.S we should talk about the races I just don't understand the relationship between this correlation and politics right so we know the case that the Harper conservatives did a really good job of politicizing relatively conservative groups throughout the GTA that supported the conservative party we know that that the the Cuban population in Florida has been going very far right lately and supported Trump and in part the Hispanic population voting for Trump is what turned I think that state and it was in New Mexico for Trump as well so I don't know what we're doing in terms of a politics this is sociology it's not the same make up the United States the U.S census uses six different categories of race when collecting data oh great just great well like what is a census but uh just a categorization machine anyways about the demographics of the country white refers to anyone who reports their Origins as being from Europe the Middle East or Northern Africa so Irish the Middle East okay German Italian Lebanese Iranian Moroccan they're all ethnicities that go under the heading of white so Persian Falls okay yes you heard me right people of Middle Eastern descent are categorized as white by the census even if they often aren't treated as if they're white why well what's now become known as white originates from a term to refer to people of Indo-European descent the Caucasian race the term Caucasian started as a reference to the caucus mountains which run through the modern day countries of Russia Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan I can't help but feel like American racial politics shouldn't be teaching us anything that this just is so weird this is a bunch of Supreme Court Justices the race was understood as a purely biological phenomenon everyone from Europe all the way down to India was lumped into one Caucasian group so yesterday's Caucasian contained most of the people who count as today's white but also captured groups that nowadays get labeled you see the danger of doing this mono vocally I showed that video already earlier in the course about the the kind to the dangerous racist history of Caucasian and it's just being deployed here kind of uncritically I'm not happy with this video Asians such as Indians or pakistanis now many Hispanic Americans are also all suspanic is considered an ethnicity not a race for census purposes so in the 2010 census 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified so a census is for governmentality right it's for us to govern and it allows us to categorize what we consider important and picks the data that we want to do over we we need it to to do policy in order to show policy impact and outcomes which is why it was so dangerous when Canada lost the the census for a couple years because our data no longer is complete but we don't have to treat it uncritically provide themselves as white while 36.7 percent identified themselves as some other race and smaller percentages identified themselves as one of the other racial groups black or African Americans or the SEC I think the number four religion in the UK is Jedi because people can enter it on the census okay hit largest racial group in the United States and are defined as individuals with African Heritage including those who are afro-caribbean since many African-Americans ancestors were forcibly brought to the United States as slaves the countries that their ancestors originated from are often unknown to this day the remnants of slavery and the southern plantation systems can be seen in the geographic distribution of black Americans around the country though many black Americans moved to Northern cities during the Great Migration of the early 20th century most remained in the south in a region that has come to be known as the black belt of the United States the third racial category used in the census is American Indian or Alaska native which refers to anyone whose Origins are indigenous to the contiguous United States and Alaska though Native Americans numbered in the millions when Europeans first arrived in the 15th century today they control only two percent of the country's land area make up just 0.2 percent of the US population and remains severely disadvantaged in terms of access to education and income the fourth census category for race Asian refers to origins in eastern Asia southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent including China India Japan Pakistan the Philippines and Vietnam the largest subgroup of Asian Americans are those so like the whole world okay it was a Chinese ancestry who make up a little less than one-fourth of the total Asian American population the fifth census category is native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander which refers to people whose Origins are from Hawaii Guam Samoa or other Pacific Islands as I mentioned before Hawaii is one of the states where a minority race is the majority race for the state and in fact it's the only state that has always been minority majority the last census category is just to catch all some other race you might remember that about a third of Hispanic Americans fall into this group if a person lists a country of origin that doesn't fit in one of the other categories they get stuck in this group you might be thinking that these categories don't seem like the racial groups you typically think of and that's okay they also don't seem to make any sense and reflect the ways in which power doesn't make any sense and it's deployed in strategically over space and time hey in all likelihood the way that the government defines remember because like Puerto Ricans don't have representation either does anybody in Guam like what are we doing here there's all sorts of colonial relationships here that we're just glossing over I mean Washington DC is still doesn't have full statehood right like it says we'll continue to change to incorporate our society's changing Notions of race and ethnicity and something that should be clear from everything we talked about today is that races aren't fixed immutable categories they are defined by societies today we learned that but should we challenge them I have no sense of the politics here we just go about race as if it's socially constructed but we're not involved in its construction in these videos that I literally showed in class that are constructing Notions of what you think are a race the difference between races and ethnicities we discussed how definitions of races and ethnicities have changed over time and across places we also discussed the terms minority and minority majority and we finished that by discussing how races are defined in the United States should we use the us as a template here I feel like it's a bad idea anyways there's these in here I'm sure we'll talk about the stuff in class and these are the concepts I went over everything what cultural racism because I don't I mean we can go into it but I I wouldn't include that because I don't think it's a useful way to do systemic makes sense racialization race institutional racism imperialism ethnicity maybe but I think they're all contested Concepts
