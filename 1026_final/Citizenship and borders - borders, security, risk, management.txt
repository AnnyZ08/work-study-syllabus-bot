 so we can talk borders [Music] borders are performative there's all ways in which they're performative but the main one being that they signal to the population levels of security and they become a way in which you can securitize the border so back to the premise of securitization you say there's a threat at the border your populace accept or rejects that threat and they're willing to do things because of that they're accepting of it for a time I don't know what your framing is about I think it's in response to events I guess so 911 was a big event we were very concerned about terrorism we did all sorts of things good and bad as a consequence of that then but over time we just have waned in our interest in that so even this chapter frames the question of borders through the covid situation right so we frame borders performatively based on the threats that we perceive at the time right um the problem of course is that borders are not a place of security they're a place of perception of security there's all sorts of reasons why Mark Salter he's got a bunch of TED Talks he's a uh he was at Ottawa I think he's still around um talks about this quite extensively but the idea of a passport as a foundation of security is just not great a passport is just a document that makes high truth claims and what do we mean by that it just means that it refers to other documents that you assume have been vetted by the state that gave that looked at them in order to give you a document that you're Now using to let somebody in or out of a country right so when somebody comes to you at the border and gives you a passport you have seconds to take that passport and do something with it so if you don't have let's say cyber infrastructure a back-end database a big list or a surveillance regime that has everybody in a database that you can relate that passport to passport is not very useful it's just a document that you're assuming that because of that country takes security seriously we can trust it that country doesn't take security seriously we can't trust it that's why it has truth claims if the passport is for example let's pick Saudi Arabia a Saudi Arabian passport you would have questions about the background and checking they were doing when for example they uh were the bulk of the 911 hijackers right so you would say when you're looking at the next passport I'm not sure that this document has high truth claims so your allies generally are ones that you trust more and the other problem is is that you have to trust that their security apparatus is actually looking at the documents properly so um you know there's all sorts of events the Millennium bomber was was let in on a fake Canadian passport the the physical thing he was holding was a real passport issue by the government the documents he used to get the passport were fake so you're hoping that your agency does a good job checking the documents that you used in order to get your passport that you're presenting when you enter to another border this could all be solved simply if all the states cooperated and they had a central database of passports and everybody could refer to everybody else and look at what documents were there but we don't want to do that right socialism some type of global government this type of stuff so so we're going to have a bad system of checking the security at the border because you've got a hope that you when you take that passport from whatever country you have intelligence from that country to assess the veracity of that passport um you also got to hope that there's no bureaucracy there so the 911 hijackers are given visas for Flight Training six months after the attacks this idea then that we have a system that efficiently operates at scale and scope for every person who is moving everywhere on the planet is just not simply a thing um you know Donald Trump famously utilized this idea that he was building a border wall walls don't work I mean maybe they worked Berlin Wall might have worked um people dig under them always have a Chapo right El Chapo you know stick up in any prison he digs his way out um I've got lots of pictures of this I should have put them in of just people you know walking over crawling over using drones to put your drugs over borders walls are great symbolic efforts they are horrible for the environment uh all they do is make it harder for people to move um they basically it's like a flow of water right sure you can Dam it up but if the backlog gets too strong it's going to push its way through so that's why I said it's similar to The War on Drugs you're going to have a war on migration but you're just going to make it more difficult you're going to kill more people but it's not going to produce better outcomes um and so I don't want to get I said I wouldn't get into it the underlying premise the family separation Pro policy is this it it's that we didn't for a while um have to detain people for a long period of time just because they presented themselves at the border to make a claim that they want to end that they have Refugee status whatever um when we decide to start detaining them because as it's still in the books and Biden never got rid of this because of the national security threat posed specifically by the Public Health crisis that was the covid-19 pandemic it allowed us to put them into places to adjudicate their claims the problem is is how do you adjudicate the claim of a baby how do you prove I would listen as a father how would I prove that my daughter because we have different last names because if I want to get into it anyways uh it's not anything complicated if it was a boy was getting my last name if we had a girl that was getting my daughter's last name and that's just how we went so whatever so I was always I still to this day don't know how I can prove that my daughter is mine um if someone challenges it I guess I'd have to have her birth certificate on me but who carries a birth certificate around because it's literally a piece of paper that if I lose it it's a real pain to get another one and so this idea then of people showing up who have traveled thousands of miles having all of their documentation in a legible way for those that are adjudicating the legibility of those claims and that your baby because you're fleeing a place that probably you weren't in a good relationship with did or didn't give you a piece of paper to prove that that baby is yours is going to result in separations right that's just going to it's going to be the adjudication so I'm not going to get too much into it that's the border wall sure you can build whatever you want build a wall that that you know Saudi Arabia trying to build that City that's a wall it's not for people it's for designers um the problem and why I say that border security isn't really a thing is that it's not really a thing it is something that we do um that there is a later one the failure rate for example they do stress tests the TSA the airport um fails in the high 80s has a high 80 failure rate I think Josh Hawley one of the U.S Republicans has got caught three times to bring live loaded weapons on planes um all it's doing is trying to capture something in 90 seconds if your security requires somebody to take a visual inspection of someone else in 90 seconds that's not really security that's theater you need intelligence Services you need back ends you need to be able to know who's coming before they get there so that you can do the proper intelligence and background checks so when they get to the Border you're ready to have them so this is what we've seen the externalization of borders it it it makes sense if you're actually interested in security then you have to do the intelligence work on the back end and you have to have a system in place so that when someone shows up you know who they are and that you've already assessed them and done your check and so this is what we're talking about shifting borders now I can't even get into all the problems with this the Borderlands has given in the U.S ice because they want to be cool immigration control enforcement a 200 mile swath of of uh territory on each side of the Border where they can operate with legality and treat it as a border situation which is to say that if the bulk of Canadian population is within 200 miles the U.S border the U.S can challenge your citizenship in those regimes as immigration enforcement not at the border so if you're operating within that 200 mile swath which the bulk of Canada's population tends to go in that and same with the the U.S uh all the population going back and forth to Mexico does that they can be challenged for having their and do you have proof of your citizenship on you at all times a a state-based document like a driver's license doesn't isn't citizenship identity you'd have to have your passport on you at all times and so what this allows them to do is create this precariousness or the shifting borders where anybody in that border Zone that Border Lands as they're called doesn't have constitutional protections anymore as traditionally defined because the border is 200 miles wide and so what we're actually getting is is efforts to deal with security through the pushing out of the borders and increasingly this kind of layered risk or mitigated risk we don't the borders aren't going to be secure but what we do try to do is assess the veracity of the risks and develop screening systems so that by the time you get to the Border all the security has been assessed and so it's more about preparedness than prevention it's more about pre-screening it's perfect security is on a sustainable uh layered security is necessary so this for example this is U.S Aviation Security intelligence Customs Joint Task Force no fly lists uh crew vetting Viper whatever the hell that is canines literal dogs uh Behavior detection travel Document chapter checkpoints check baggage Transportation Checkers random employee screening bomb appraisal detectors Federal Air Marshals Federal flight decks uh trained fight clue Law Enforcement Officers hard and cockpit doors and passengers that's a lot of stuff now you're assuming all of those actors are good actors that can't be bribed they don't do anything wrong they don't make any mistakes that's why border security is absolutely about mitigating risk but it's not about providing actual security it's about reducing the risks it's about making things reasonably mitigated right rather than producing something like a secure border and so borders are a last week zone of Defense um really the only way to do this is to increasingly restrain Freedom by having things like develop a database on you develop your backgrounds develop your uh history make sure that your passport refers to other documents and that we have a big paper trail that can do that and so with all of this involved those population that 50 of the US population that never applies for a passport never leaves the country experiences citizenship quite differently than anybody doing any of this and those groups are going to look much like a certain type of group that would travel and another type that won't and so we get kind of tourists and terrorists we get these two forms of security and then we get Management systems for them like the Nexus system which allows you to basically pay more get access to a better system that pre-does all the pre-checks does the background checks does Deeper levels of security before you get to the border so you experience the Border more quickly than those who don't have access to those things and so this idea of intelligence rights are always going to be intention and this externalization of the borders is going to allow you to do things if you have the means to do so differently and so the border is experienced differently and it's not one form of security it's based on all those criteria and those people who move more that's my nice way of saying they have elements of foreign it's just so bad that's how we determine degrees of security and of course these are going to find it follow very hierarchical form so if the bulk of the population never moves and has a passport looks a certain way it doesn't have a passport it looks a certain way that group when they get passports are also being adjudicated by people who look like them at those places of screening and so you can see how this happens
