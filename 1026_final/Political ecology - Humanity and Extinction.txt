 so we'll deal with this idea of political ecology disrupting political science maybe um I do think this is an issue the idea of State sovereignty as a monarch who has a singular hierarchical authority over a given territory which means that that territory is is at their disposal it was traditionally from this notion this Western notion of a monarch having Divine rule right back to the Sovereign will to Hobbes um so this framework at least wants to you know equalize it it wants to make the idea of the social and natural world as mutually constituted rooted in and shaping each other so this is similar to talk to about the tour a bit in the course but this idea that humans not outside of nature but within nature and so then we have to bring this in because when we have thought in the past about things like social Revolution public policy trade relations democracy citizenship human rights and development we don't think about the ecological World very much so when we we develop things and I'm just using this example the NAFTA agreement that was just renegotiated Canada has been trying to adopt this feminist foreign policy and so one of the things we want to do when we're dealing with trade agreements is that we want to bring in things like environment indigenous issues and gender um so NAFTA has always had a little bit to deal with the environment um but it's it's largely been on a voluntary basis or a small kind of peripheral off to the side basis and the other problem is is that in a trade agreement because of sovereignty if and this is this happened in the trading route if we want to bring up indigenous issues with the U.S in a bilateral Trade Agreement they just simply say no and you can't force another state to do anything and so that's a consequence of that so this is Stephen Gill that has been referenced a couple times the textbook but he has a framework for this it's just called this kind of disciplinary system that we have trade agreements then lock in things that are beneficial for trade and lock out things or put down your Adam harms has argue this in our department that they lock in things like uh you can't uh allow us to you know nationalize a business or you uh can't do anything that harms trade um and so as a consequence that that's locked in but things like environmental issues that are those are left the domestic level and so we have a whole system of what is called this kind of mutual legal agreements that establish everybody has to trade continue trade and allow trade to happen um and but we don't have anything similar for the environment it's all voluntary so he's just talking about new constitutionalism is the legal and juridical counterpart it it it develops constitutional legal and Nursery mechanisms to lock in that power through legislation Etc and agreements such as ttip trading investment agreements and in so doing it seeks to lock out Democratic forces in the making of fundamental policies to govern our economies and societies in what way does ttip also reflect a crisis of democracy well it it is negotiated in secret it has proposed adjudication mechanisms which are basically privatized adjudication method mechanisms it empowers uh corporations it gives corporations certain rights and freedoms so it's a very peculiar version of the rule of law insofar as the institutions of representative democracy and popular participation are not in any significant way involved in the making of This policy the adjudication of this policy is not in open courts through traditional mechanisms of adjudication by judges so it's almost a kind of self-regulation on behalf of capital governed by constitutional protections that lock out forms of democratic participation that we've been traditionally used what so when we're talking about these policies then we're not talking about policies that we have a say over in part because political science in particular has said if we want to pass these trade agreements and continue the embedded liberal framework that ensures that free trade free markets and the free flow of capital is the set the foundation of economic growth development and investment we need to do so when there's increasing opposition to those type of systems so what do we do we increasingly go more and more secretive develop these things in secret as effective policy making tools but those effective policy making tools are not being used in other Realms such as environment gender indigenous issues so this is just a bit this isn't great example I couldn't find any on on we believe that it's really important to have a chapter environment and NAFTA because the environment and the economy go together it goes together in positive ways that we believe that trade is important and that as we move to a cleaner future that Canada can work with Mexico the United States to really attract investment in the NAFTA region because we have high standards but of course Canadians expect us to protect our right to regulate we don't want to see a Flint Michigan situation we have 40 million people who rely on the Great Lakes for clean drinking water also the economic benefits the Great Lakes has been billions of dollars and so we're going to be smart about this we also understand that climate change is real and we signed on to the Paris agreement that was supported by the provinces and territories and we want to see that reflected as well so the problem with that is the way that it's framed is that it's framed in terms of national interest and National sovereignty so if you are saying that Canada has the right to set these terms for itself its own National regulation you're also saying the Americans have the right to set those terms for themselves and they can be we don't want regulation we want to defund the EPA we want to move in the opposite direction so this idea of scale which scale things happen at is important so if we're doing all our environmental activism at the uh the global scale at the UN and the local scale in our individual actions but we're not doing anything in these international trade agreements at the international level just below the global and above the national we've got a whole realm that's very effective in organizing political activity but not about environmental issues so scale really does matter here and so the idea of doing this across scales means that it should be at least we should making be making similar efforts at every scale and level and so you've got all of this they use the example of the deforestation in the the Amazon you've got local actors loggers indigenous people fighting this idea of the expropriation of their territory extractivism you've got Regional National governments so those governments can be expanding this so internationally we can be putting pressure on um Brazil not to cut down the rainforest but domestically they can be encouraging it we have ngos international non-governmental organizations coming in trying to buy up some of the rainforest to stop it from being exploited but then we have the multinational companies going in and saying here I can develop this for you we will get you to Market if you've got this stuff we will get it out for you and so there's consumerism in there so the idea here is that scale matters a lot and when we're talking about things at the at this level um we probably need a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts that we're having on the earth not just in our specific areas but as a whole and so that's the idea of the anthropocene it's on this kind of broad huge long geological scale have you heard about the anthropocene for the last 200 years humankind has caused such a Negative imprint on the environment that some scientists describe it as a new geological age the age of human impact on Earth or the anthropocene it's the pre-industrial era and especially since the second half of the last century the degradation of the environment and the climate change caused by humans have increased at a rate never seen in any other time in history this is happy music what are the causes of the anthropocene there are two main ones the model of energy production and the resource consumption model the energy produced from coal oil and natural gas emits large amounts of greenhouse gases the main causes of global warming [Music] for its part the growing population needs a greater use of natural resources that nowadays surpasses the capacity of the earth to regenerate them these human actions cause among other consequences changes in the water cycle imbalances and destructions in the marine and terrestrial ecosystems the increase of extreme meteorological phenomena the acidification of the oceans or The Disappearance of the forests foreign is it possible to stop the devastating impact we are having on the planet yes although there are certain irreversible consequences we can still mitigate much of the damage caused to the environment it is necessary to tackle the problem at its root carbonizing the economy and relying on renewable and non-polluting energy sources such as the sun the water and the wind also making a responsible and equal use of Natural Resources will help achieve a more sustainable system that can prevent the anthropocene from becoming the last era of our planet good luck with that um so the problem here is that I mean that's a really tight like most of that impact has happened within the last hundred years right so much like that we're able to have such a massive impact and that we are extracting energy and we're consuming these resources at a scale and scope that are really fast um and so we are caught up in these big patterns it's not clear like they're saying mitigation and sustainability this is this Net Zero stuff that I talked about before it's it's they're Frameworks that still imply that we can we have at least some level of sustainability I I don't know where that comes from I I don't have any evidence of it I understand it that we want to have our systems be sustainable but I watch you know houses in my area get torn down and huge ones put up over and over again and that we take this arable land and we turn it into these things I just don't have a ton of evidence that we're moving quick enough the rate of change are we making the mitigation efforts quick enough to offset the impact that we're having and then I mean you can talk about eroi I won't do it I've done it introduce yours but um it it takes a lot of energy to build a new electric car um if we're not we don't have cars at all that would be a movement in the right direction but just differently powered cars I'm not sure the rate of change is going to be faster than the impact we're having on the environment so the premise here is still that we've got a monotheistic view of the planet there's a singular world that humans have the right to extract um and that this domain for human exploitation I don't know maybe humans are just this is just what human life is like if all life is trying to like store energy so that that species can live longer then we're doing a really good job at it it just happens to destroy the environment um and so this idea of humans as the next kind of extinction level event we've had several before um we've had up to 99 percent of the life destroyed on the planet several times I think we've got five or six extinction level events in the past um and so if the humans are part of the natural world is that natural world just the next extinction level event it would cause us harm clearly because we would be extinct but it's not clear that the Earth wouldn't continue on without us and so we we'd like to argue that climate change isn't a choice but at this point everybody's been given the evidence and the data and they're making some changes but they're clearly not making radical changes so I'm just not sure about this idea that we can mitigate quickly enough um and so maybe we just need to think in different scales about different species like about who's going to live and who's going to die like in a pinch of garden soil a gram and weight there are millions of bacteria representing several thousand species many of them unknown to science the life of the ground level is a random mix of species not just fungi bacteria worms it's everything and so maybe we're just one of these species alongside the millions we don't know and therefore the extinction of one of us is not the extinction of of all of them um and so I mean this is John Green just talking about like one of these ideas about how drastic the change in the life like just the mass the biomass the mammals on the planet has been in this short period I'll maybe skip ahead a bit where he's talking about the specifics of it one of the best things that can happen to me happened to me this morning and it is thus I was on Twitter and I saw this tweet from Hannah Richie it shows current mammal biomass so this is the amount of mammal biomass that is people this is the amount that is livestock including including pets just less than one percent over there this up here just four percent of the total mammal biomass is all wild mammals including whales and then I tweeted what I thought was a throwaway this makes me wonder how much mammal biomass has increased overall since agriculture like it definitely wasn't this much but was it less or way less and then I scrolled down and she had posted the answer in response to a different person I had this question that I thought was unanswerable and it turns out one it's been answered in two it's fascinating over here is total memo biomass 100 000 years ago it dropped a lot because humans killed a lot of animals in the Americas but right now humans alone are three times more biomass than all mammals on earth a hundred thousand years ago that's Wild so this idea that we are about just in terms of like just the existence of humans regardless of everything else we all go vegan tomorrow we just eat grass whatever um we still have more biomass now on the planet than we had a hundred thousand years ago so what I don't know about this notion of uh sustainability um and that maybe like we are just part of an if we really want to be part of an ecosystem you know eight percent of our DNA is the remnants of ancient viruses and 40 is is genetic material that has a viral origin we don't know about so we actually don't know a whole lot about ourselves genetically and we're just not clear about how much of his is nature the bulk of us is is made up of bacteria and things that aren't human DNA there are other things and so we like to think of ourselves as coherent holes but if we start messing with the scale we could see ourselves as the source of a whole bunch of bacteria and therefore maybe we aren't the ones that are supposed to survive at some other element of us that's supposed to it's messed up this is the weird part about this is taking this um political ecology to its kind of its conclusions
