 so we'll just finish off with the textbook video I couldn't find the exact one but this is the same arguments being made so it'll be similar to what was there say they were stunned the scope of the U.S announcement to withdraw almost 12 000 troops from Germany including moving fighter jets from the spangdalum Air Force Base to Italy and the U.S European command from Stuttgart to Belgium it is the biggest shakeup of U.S forces in Europe since World War II defense secretary Mark esper said this at the Pentagon these changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing U.S and NATO deterrence of Russia strengthening NATO reassuring allies and improving U.S strategic flexibility and ucom operational flexibility but at the White House president Donald Trump made clear that he also has other reasons for the sweeping changes why would we keep all of those troops there and now Germany's saying it's bad for their economy well it's good for our economy Germany so bad for their economy good for our economy the other video just talked about the idea that it's this this notion that Germany wasn't paying enough into NATO I mean very few of the NATO allies so this is a good example here right military security we're banding together we're cooperating together in NATO everybody cooperates lets us do things like um go in and get Gaddafi uh Canada amongst many others aren't doing as part of the NATO agreement you're supposed to spend two percent of GDP on the military we we don't we simply don't most of them don't uh Germany actually kind of is closer than most um but you know Trump is was saying here that if you're not cooperating so this is a liberal part if you're not engaging in literal cooperation we're going to put punishments in to try to make you cooperate they're not like coercive punishments are not causing harm per se but they're trying to say that that cooperation isn't coming um so therefore we're not going to do it this is from Voice of America which is the U.S military kind of um news station so it's funny that we can barely hear what his criticism Trump has had harsh criticism for Germany for years appearing to view it as an economic threat instead of a close partner and observers have noted his cool interactions with Chancellor Angela Merkel some transatlantic experts say the announcement deals a body blow to the critical U.S German relationship weakens NATO and delights Russian President Vladimir Putin but any removal of U.S headquarters in Germany which had been there for decades which are cement in our relationship not only with Europe but with Germany it's just fundamentally undermines U.S security interests I think Watchers are clearly surprised at the speed at which the administration is potentially moving forward other experts say the move is likely to hurt America's own strategic interest more than it hurts Germany or Europe so this is the tough one right so the U.S can do whatever it wants it's got the power to do what it wants it can act and self-interest like the realist says but the Cooperative Arrangements security Arrangements of NATO were beneficial and actually helped its interest and now this could be said to be one of the reasons that Putin thought it was easier to go into Ukraine it's because you've done this we've moved from a unipolar system to a multi-polar system where we're not sure again is still a very important Hub or you know declarations in North Africa in the Middle East oh my God the audience and if you reduce Personnel from these hubs basically you're responsive the less strategic value by not having them there the audio is not great and so this idea of of the the things that happen globally in those kind of interactions the the nation-state model the um the liberal model this Marxist model of inequality the feminist model the constructivist model they all explain the events in different ways and have different things to say and so this is the kind of tougher part about dealing with the international is that we have to decide which story we think is most compelling given the events that have taken place we don't know that the approach is the best one to do that famously we have there's a case study a classic case study in in international relations at the Cuban Missile Crisis that adopts all three different approaches it adopts three different approaches with three different Frameworks and they all explain the events and so they they're mutually exclusive they don't need to explain what the other one's doing but they can also explain the outcome and so theories International theories international relations tries to capture some of global politics but it's not going to capture all of it because it's going to be necessarily incomplete this is an open system a complex system where they interact with one another and all these different approaches a plain explain different aspects
