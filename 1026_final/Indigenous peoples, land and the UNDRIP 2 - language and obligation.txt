 so I should have included in the last discussion on language but the idea of terminology here does matter um we should be conscious of language in the way in which it's used so um as the textbook says in box 6.1 you know indigenous is a term that accompanies diverse Nations and peoples who have long-standing connections to territories um it really started in the 1970s and thinking about these contexts in specifically the UN drip Aboriginal is a term in the the constitution in 1982 and includes First Nations Inuit and metis First Nations refers to people or descendants of the original inhabitants of Canada um and then we've got the Inuit refers to specific groups of people living in the Arctic again it's such an amalgamation I'm not sure so this is what I'm saying when we're talking about language we're really talking top down when we're coming up with these terms now people have to use these terms in order to get recognition but it's not a useful like exercise in identity formation per se it's largely like the ways in which we navigate settler States so metis is people who are have have unions or or the product of relationships between um indigenous women fur Traders but really any any kind of relationship that develops over time not all people who have those relationships have metis status and and vice versa all of these questions come back to to issues relating specifically to the reason we still use the word Indian Act is because it's enshrined in a piece of legislation and the charter and then it re confers status and so status has been a long contentious issue a gendered issue an issue relating to the questions of democracy and how we can think about these things it's it's it's very complicated in part because it's all of these efforts of the state to make all of the different communities assimilate into a single category that they can be referenced to or or are controlled or modified um I mean I've got an article I don't know if I included it yet but I I can it's it's um indigenous peoples are migrants too for a period in the 60s and 70s the the federal government thought it was a good idea to try to treat indigenous groups as as immigrants because it saw the idea of assimilation that it was happening with with migrants from around the world as a strategy they could use to assimilate and so this assimilation issue has been the persistent issue it is what gives rise to um the UN drip it's this thing that takes decades to complete these settler States in particular participated in the process there's lots of documentation on this as strategies to obfuscate slow down um um challenge undermine make legible uh changing all these claims and recognizing them as distinct peoples now there's all sorts of ways in which the UN has been a site of contestation people have been showing up uh indigenous communities black communities uh communities that have been oppressed have been showing up in New York in front of um the the general assembly and yelling about these things as long as the U.N has existed we just generally don't recognize or think about those things because they don't come up in standard history so the premise of un drip and it's most simple like to for you to understand is just it's a mechanism to establish the distinct human rights of indigenous communities around the world if you look at the social determinants of health so things that cause negative Health outcomes indigenous communities worldwide have lower social determinants of Health regardless of where they are Sweden wherever then the the settler or dominant population it's it's just this I mean it's there why because of all of these things because of the lack of specific human rights protections this constant desire to assimilate indigenous communities in order to create the modern nation state right to create a a single people and so this distinct peoplehood is challenging the demos of the Democracy right that I've been talking about throughout this course the idea that that happens so there's a duty to consult and cooperate again this isn't explained well in the text specifically in relationship to um the the cons consultation and cooperation remember the honor and dignity the crown is at stake here so it cannot be an adversarial relationship a lot of settlers when they look at things like land claims or they look at the pipeline debates they look at it well we'll just take an adversarial relationship we do this with minority groups all the time they want something and we say no but that's not that adversarial relationship cannot buy our own Constitution it's unconstitutional to do that so um and so you know the Americans love their constitution candidate kind of ignores its Constitution let's say um and so free prior informed consent for resource development and then self uh government self-determination rights more specifically we can get into some of the more specifics of it um indigenous people have the right to maintain and strengthen distinct legal economic and social and cultural Traditions I'll talk about Canada's multi-juridical legal foundations in a bit um I spent a lot more time on it in our international law class that we have at the third year level uh every indigenous every indigenous individual has the right to a nationality right so stripping away nationalities is stripping away their identities in order to create a unified category and so this is the problem of indigenous as a as a way of thinking it's it's a largely an imposed construct that is useful in terms of political mobilization but not necessarily useful in telling us anything about anybody's experience right uh indigenous peoples have and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture so this is I mean I've got web wub canoe talking about this later about the get over it stuff right so that's constant kind of Perpetual Western way of thinking well it's in the past right so why if it's in the past and the whole point here is that it's no it's in the present right it's on constant ongoing and that's what the reservation dogs does really well it deals with the struggles of the the president and the past and with kids right because that's what they have to do right to establish and control their education systems because education is a key form of identity and identity formation and digital people have the right to participate in decision making matters that would affect their rights so rights and then the ability to talk about and defend those rights and Indigenous people have the right to determine their identity and membership in accordance with their own customs and traditions I didn't put anything in here but we have had in the academy and there's been a couple institutions in particular I mean we've been renaming the institutions but we have this phenomenon of pretendians um we have white settlers who just claim to appropriate indigenous identity in order to get access to resources it's kind of like Stolen Valor in the states like pretending like you're a veteran this is a pretending as people doing this this happens there was a a couple of teens who were doing this or claiming they're Inuit in Brampton we have academics judges um people doing this in order to like participate in this and so we have to give the communities the right to do this um to set their own membership and identity especially when people are appropriating that identity for their own purposes and so when we think about these things this this the UN drip is very similar to the the human rights that the charter in the U.N which defines our human rights which we'll talk about when we get to International organizations later in the course your human rights are absolutely enshrined in these documents but they don't have the force of legal status per se because it's up to every individual nation state to set up the legal codes processes appeals processes follow the jurisprudence so the the rules about how you interpret the law in your own culture and tradition right so they're set up differently the key Point here is that the settler States who worked in this process for 30 years when the process was complete rejected the process um and so you know Canada asserted that these were already protected in section 35 of the Constitution Act um they I'll talk a bit about how this resistance happens and why this resistance happens if it took 30 years and it's not legally binding why are why are we still fighting it it just it it's this reflection of the ways in which settlement is an ongoing practice and I'm suspicious the way that the text frames colonialism because we need to talk more about settler colonialism um and so the ways in which appropriation of of attitudes and opinions this is just um there are so many of these I've got a couple I'll just show a couple about the ways in which like these efforts to I guess because we're talking about identity right this chapter is about identity the ways in which this identity becomes distorted so quickly so here we'll we'll talk to this one I think it's great that land acknowledgments are becoming more commonplace you know however I do think there is a time and place for land acknowledgments and one of those times and places is not on Zoom I was working for a company for like most of the lockdown and the head of HR who's very much not indigenous started doing land acknowledgments during our weekly Zoom check-in meetings and there was one meeting where he was like zooming in from his five bedroom home in Upstate New York he's shouting into his camera sorry if it's difficult to hear me I can't figure out how to turn off my indoor waterfall we are on Lenape land I feel like land acknowledgments are going to get co-opted by corporations very much like gay pride I'm dreading the day that I walk into like a Warby Parker and there's like a huge banner and it's just like we're on Stolen land and then right below that it's like you know what else is a steal two frames for forty nine dollars because I will fully walk out over there with four frames I think so um Canada's opposition uh to the U.N drip was based on a bunch of different claims first and foremost you know it's something in the federal government or the idea of sovereignty that makes those who work for the federal government think that a non-binding document would implicate them and and all sorts of legal issues uh so it was framed in terms of Constitution Act and for terms of the charter and the idea of defense and security the idea that this would have implications for how we think about this and so Canada said well we're making lots of progress on the on based on good faith partnership and mutual respect um the assembly First Nation said candidate no do this the metis Federation said they expressed concern and that there was Expressions explicit expressions of why is Canada not doing this Mr Speaker this morning MP's gathered at a meeting on Parliament Hill in support of the U.N Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples the meeting was hosted by a group of organizations including the Assembly of First Nations Amnesty International Canada the Inuit kanatami the Inuit circumpolar Council the Canadian France service committee Kairos and the native women's Association of Canada their voices were strong and unanimous and calling on the government of Canada to fully Implement standards at the declaration adopted by the U.N general assembly on September 13th of last year as members of this house will remember the Declaration was passed by an overwhelming majority vote of 144 to 4 with Canada's conservative government shamefully voting against rights for indigenous people Mr Speaker this government must realize Canadians took pride in our reputation in the role we used to have as human rights champions in the global Community they should take back this role and implement the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples today so this idea of of the problems well one is that we have this act embedded in the Constitution which you know is a testament to White stupidity is that it's called Indian um that this is framed in there and then it defines very clearly relationship status obligations resources all of these things are in there on top of that federalism and this is a Perpetual problem and I'll talk about it a bit when in the context of Caledonia and the Six Nations um that um treaties are set at the federal level but in Canadian federalism provinces have huge amounts of control over landlord water resources and energy and so there's always been this mismatch that the treaty relationships are supposed to be at the federal level but for example in Caledonia you have the opp enforcing land rights for a subdivision that's going on contested territory right um and so without due consultation so this idea is built into that we also have questions about the legality of of practices of forced assimilation which continue to challenge I mean Pam Paul matters argued that I don't have enough of her in here she's on Tick Tock as well um does great work that you know the ways in which it's been reformed a bit but that essentially status is becoming harder and harder to maintain I'll talk about what status is later and that Canada is moving towards a slow-moving genocide where we're going to have many indigenous peoples but none with status right and so this creates all sorts of questions and then the illegal appropriation of territory um this unconstitutional occupation of territory and then at the time Stephen Harper went and has said this so these are all the treaties but Stephen Harper went and said this which wasn't great we have one of the Atlantic regime's unbroken Democratic regimes in the in history we are one of the most stable regimes in history there are very few countries that can say for our nearly 150 years they've had the same political system without any social breakdown political upheaval or invasion uh we are unique in that regard we also have no history of colonialism so we have all of the things that many people admire about the great Powers but none of the things that threaten or bother them about the great Powers we all so that is the the Canada problem um so he he's later said that that was a mistake and he shouldn't have said that um in part because there was so much outrage that he said that um and so by 2010 the government of Canada says that it will support it um this non-binding agreement of it and then Australia New Zealand so these are the four states that voted against it all agreed to its endorsement eventually under great pressure so the problem of course is that how do we frame this understanding of Rights granted this is not even you know barely a decade ago that why is it take so long to do this and so the way that it's framed in the textbook is is in terms of a product of European colonialism I'm going to add the settler in because I think it's appropriate I think it's how we think about these things and I think there's a key distinction here right so this is and we'll talk about what this case this is not the colonialism um the the difference is is as I mentioned earlier in the course salt water versus settler the salt water is normally the use of military forces occupied territory control those people and utilize those people for these ends in many cases what we're doing here is just trying to terminate in in every way treaty obligations rights and lives in order to take the land right so the annexation of territory by Imperial States settlement in and control over those territories um often using the family just simply in Caledonia it's building a subdivision why would you be opposed to building a subdivision because it it violates all of these principles and and treaties and Charter rights that have been established but that we just kind of forget about and subjugation of all these forms of life I'll just do one more tick talk about thinking about the ways in which different communities are involved in these ongoing settlement practices in the ways in which they don't and so Scotland has experienced its own kind of colonial relationship with uh the the British and and then gets framed in terms of how can we think about these things this is also framed in terms of Irish questions and things around that but one of the ways in which this gets built into and forgotten kind of perpetually so here's just a tick tock talking about the ways in which Scotland is implicated in all of these processes learn your own history genocide to the natives slavery stay out of ours this is going to be a hard pill for you to swallow that is your history that is our shared history I mean Edinburgh and Aberdeen and Glasgow the self-titled Second City of the Empire they were built with wealth at colonialism and slavery provided do you think the merchants in merchant City we're selling or how Scotland's first millionaires became millionaires probably not did you think it's just a coincidence that black American and Caribbean people have Scottish surnames do you know why the Jamaican flag has a saltire on it I doubt it I you tell yourself Jamaica street is called that because some glass region just really liked Bob Marley Scotland was a willing and active participant in the colonization of the U.S and the transatlantic slave trade take all the time you need with that so a lot of what we're doing here is just kind of unpacking the ways in which we forget we forget every time we speak we forget what the language we use we forget when we just say oh it's just you know it's just a a mascot team name what's the big deal it's just the name of a street what's the big deal it's just the name of a school what's the big deal and so our language is a foreman this is what I've been kind of arguing throughout the course our language is a form of ongoing practices of forgetting because by choosing who gets to speak how they could speak which language is used and how we frame those issues
