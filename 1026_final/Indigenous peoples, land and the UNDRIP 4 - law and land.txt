 so as I mentioned at the end of the last video the law in Canada is a key part of how we can think about settler colonialism rights and responsibilities um it's our possibility of thinking it and in a real sense the law bounds identity and so we're talking about indigenous identities I don't know how you can talk about it without talking about status so this is I think it was a Maori um tick tocker asking a tick talker about what is status and how does that function in Canada because it's it's different right each state and each territory has different ways of doing it um but I don't know what a status card is so I'm actually just making this video to open up the floor to this is a status card as you can see up there it says certificate of Indian status because in Canada the legal definition is still Indian as Indian and this is only for people who are First Nations this does not include the other two indigenous groups in Canada the Inuit or the metis eligibility for a status is set by the government it's not set by our own peoples [Music] um and it's been over the years over the decades centuries it has had a lot of sexism within it so before 1985 the status Indian woman married a non-status man she lost her status their kids a longer at status but if a status man married a non-sized woman that woman for 1985 gained full Indian status and got all the rights and entitlements of that allowed and there's also different categories within the status of the six one and the six two so six one is what would be considered against like a full Indian six two is half so if a 6-1 has a kid with a non-status person if their kid is a six two the six two as a kid to the non-statist person their kid will not have status eligility may have just changed recently there's been several changes so you know that might not be the case I just became eligible for Indian status two years ago my mom has had status since I was born my grandmother was born and raised on a reserve so I very much know my community know my family there since birth you know the status card doesn't change who I am it just now entitles me to certain rights that I didn't have before this includes now I can vote for Chief and Council for my band elections which we have one coming up June 1st I'm gonna be 35 next month and this is the first time I've been eligible to vote um it also entitles me to certain health benefits so Optical Medical Dental that unless I had health benefits through work I didn't really have the coverage for that kind of stuff I'm also now eligible for tax exemption sales tax exemption uh when I'm shopping so certain goods and services within uh this is the province of Ontario if I show my status card I'll have part of the taxes removed and then if I lived on or on reserve and worked on reserve I would be entitled to the exempt from paying income taxes which is not the case for all status Indians depending where they live and who they work for and now that I have status I am a member of my first nation now if I went to post-secondary school I could apply for funding to help pay for my tuition housing this and that that so that I wouldn't potentially have to pay or get a student loan which I currently had to do because at what I went to University in college before I got status so I have status that like many people do so I hope that helps and anyone feel free to jump in if they have any corrections or anything anything to add into it in the comments um so I mean there's this this weird way in which settlements status treaties obligations qualification identity are still bound up in the settler State and the the legal claims and the adjudication of those claims and the disputes over those claims and the the constant kind of churning so much so that like we we both have to double check our sources all the time on what's the current status of status right which I mean not being able to vote till you're 35 having student loans because your status wasn't adjudicated it's just it it's weird right um it's not weird it's gross but you know whatever um and so Canada has all sorts of of legal traditions because it has uh civil law common law indigenous legal Traditions they all exist here they're overlapping the French have a different jurisprudence a different way of adjudicating law than British common law remember the Brits don't have a constitution they just have a series of precedents that we refer back to Major precedents that then inform how we interpret cases right and so there's a general lack of knowledge about Canada's indigenous law as I started from the beginning of this course the Great Law of Peace is an international treaty that predates West failure that the 19648 treaty the Canadian Supreme Court recognizes the continued existence of indigenous legal traditions and very clearly said settlement did not terminate the interest in Aboriginal people's arriving from their historic occupation and use of the land but we still have this is John Burroughs I took all this from John Burroughs his work on Canada's indigenous history um where he says he's encountered I've encountered I have talked to lawyers uh real estate lawyers corporate lawyers all the rest of that I've talked to them personally um and they say exactly this you say indigenous law exists I don't believe it for a moment okay good talk um and so we have these legacies that are built into how we we deal with this to the monarchy still part of the identity the crown is still the one that we engage in that uses the basis of authority like if it's a crown why can't we just remove it and put something else there um and so I do think it's this idea of having multiple Traditions should make us more cautious about definitively saying this is what Canada is because for uh the quebecois for um different communities within Canada they have different experiences of when their Province entered into Confederation or didn't um and and the recognition of this and so there's this kind of fiction that we re reproduce I guess with with hockey and beer of a single Canadian identity versus this Multicultural tradition that's not about cultures necessarily of settlers of different cultural backgrounds but of of the different kind of legal precedents that establish what like what you can do when you can vote things like that um we have all this it's already built into our thing we have Canada Queen God as these kind of sacred legal Traditions that are basis of authority that are have to do with a specific understanding of Faith rather than you know this idea that treaties create values and the hot energy entered into a series of alliances in Joseph Brandt in particular a series of alliances with the crown prior to the existence of Canada right I think well not Joseph Brandt but but these these relationships uh are established well before Canada is confederated right um and so weirdly enough using natural law whether we saw with Hub and lox and Rousseau um indigenous peoples are natural because it doesn't make any logical sense because if they have structures or they have capabilities or medicines their Traditions or practices or theories or States then the the Locking and mixing your land with labor comes apart right and so this idea of of framing capacities which we use all the time we recognize all the time part of the the reason that none of it exists as none of it is that it was a mutual recognition between the federal government and and none of it as a territory that we could use in our Arctic sovereignty claims when we fight with the Russians and the Americans um different in Inuit communities their existence on the territory for ten thousand years to argue that that's Canadian sovereignty and so it's this weird kind of of function and so here's just wob canoe talking about this this 500 years went wrong wasn't always like this when we started down the path when the settlers first arrived the natives welcome them and help them out it wasn't like they showed up and the native said oh there goes the neighborhood and the relationship grew stronger fashionable even remember these it's a beaver hat this was considered cool back in the day that's right our rodents were all the rage in 17th century Europe that led to the fur trade and of course the fur trade gave us Canada like most major Canadian cities were fur trading outposts and all of this was because we were settling at the fur Traders were trading beaver pelts to go on top hats in Europe fashion is an integral part of what it why Canada is where it is and what it matters it's closest to the beaver right so like beavers dictate Canada and this has been a long-running joke about Canada and the Beaver um ceases in the 80s had a logo that was a beaver with sunglasses the Canadian Security intelligence service had added sunglasses logo with it like pulled up secret a secret Beaver as their logo for a time they we documented that in wampum belts like this one that depict two canoes traveling down the river in parallel paths neither one interfering with the other stay in your life and the English and French well for their part they signed all sorts of big agreements with great seals ever since the Royal Proclamation of 1763 there's been Banner promises like the natives will not be molested or my personal favorite the Queen's promise to the cree of bounty and benevolence you know we Aboriginal people thought we were getting a seat at the big table but it turns out we had a reservation at a much smaller table out the back near the garbage cans at the big table they got Canada and all of its Bounty at our table a total lack of benevolence we got the plague a plague of whiskey and our parents and Grandparents were molested in schools designed to Kill The Indian in the child so where did all of that go wrong well step into my office grab a seat on the big couch and let's talk so that's from CBC 8th Fire series that was kind of went through all this stuff but again if we don't watch it it becomes historical it's like oh that's old look at how uh uh look at how it is all grainy and all the rest of it so anyways um we'll come to this at the Terra nollis is a Perpetual theme of this chapter um about the idea of land and then it not being occupied um in the legal literature um you know it was too unfamiliar to the settlers for us to understand indigenous law um we use English law in our textbooks when we think about law there is a central Paradox here of that the crown sought indigenous agreement before settlement and Indigenous communities had to be recognized by the crown but weren't equal to the crown and so the discovery of land by treaty meant that there had to be some existence of somebody there um and so how can you enter into a treaty with someone who doesn't have rights right or doesn't exist and so it's this this weird uh framework I I'm actually not going to deal with this the the danger of the the Canadian people here is that it's part of this fictitious beginning of those who are outside the law are somehow not part of the people which doesn't make a ton of sense um the people is often used as the foundation like the threat to the people is used for us to for example in the war measures act suspend everyone's rule of law and it also allows the people to to do things like um take those who are seemingly in Canada but aren't the people to be interned and so the history of Canada is also about the history of putting people in in specific places because we consider them not people German Slavic ukrainians during World War one German Italian Japanese during World War II um the weird part about all of this land claim negotiation and this is from finding Dasha Stephanie ilbecker Fox has a book on this specifically dealing with the DNA and they're dealing with um land claims and that this is the experience of uh what land claims actually looks like and why it takes so long to do these territory things so if you get a new job in the federal government um they're normally appointed by officials from Ottawa with limited knowledge of these issues they're universally educated um uh non-indigenous who normally have one indigenous advisor they get given a series of bottom lines but from the federal government they have to submit spending reports and the funding levels so that's Indian Northern Affairs Canada um they they submit them to the federal government which kind of uses that as part of the costs and those funding levels are determined by the bureaucracy the extent to which they're actually going to substantially engage in negotiation they're largely done in English with local translators three to five days a month with local community centers so if you want to know why some of these land claims take decades and decades to adjudicate it's because you're dealing with a federal government that by all metrics given in the territory of Canada is relatively weak versus the resources of the provinces and they are flown in to deal with this they tend to be male and they tend to do this in order to get a stepping stone to a better job in the federal government so they have a high level of burnout they have short-term positions they're frustrated with this remote this remote status so people who are ignorant of the context and history come in and why do they how do you negotiate with people who hate you they're not here to change the past right this type of kind of the blankness of the western experience and then on the other side you have the indigenous negotiators from the community have an extensive knowledge of the history the process the land claims may or may not have University knowledge of the federal government's experience the region probably going back a very long time of the previous claims the legal assumptions so every time you enter into this every three to five years you have to bring the whoever's been sent in back up to speed talk to them about what there are they're trying to deal with their bottom lines and that they're doing it so we've got lots of examples of this but like David Peterson there's a whole bunch of of politicians who when they retired um even um uh oh my God it's not Gretchen it's um Paul um Paul Martin when he retired he decided to go just deal with these issues because from the inside we have multiple leaders at high levels that I got onto this issue from it was a federal judge who after he um retired did nothing but spent his time working on the 1763 Proclamation um and so it's because they get into this and they say we have to educate the government officials while negotiating their erroneous assumptions their ignorance their lack of knowledge and it just results in negotiation after negotiation after decade after decade so like that video we saw in the past when you're dealing with with something as as absurd as a treaty that should have been dealt with in the 1800s this is why it continues to the present they they continued the present then it goes through appeals over and over again the law is integral to settlement it legitimates settlement but it also drags these things out and the deployment of these strategies of settlement are ongoing this is why we're talking about treaties so much this is why we're doing reconciliation it's to overcome this structural problem that is built into the way that we think about the relationship of the law to what it means to be on this territory
