 so if we jettison the idea that there is something fundamentally new about the ways in which these questions come to us then we can kind of start to unpack some of the assumptions that are built into how we think about digital Technologies and democracy certainly it matters I I don't know if I agree with this assertion we've always had this I mean the the myth of a mass media has largely been that people get their data all from one sources I don't know that that's the case there have always been rumors conspiracy theories Whispers gossip those type of things they they matter right as we've talked about before and as a consequence of that then maybe McLaren's medium is the message is the point of like something like the CBC for example isn't that the content on the CBC means anything it's that we are accessing the CBC as a free or as a publicly subsidized um National infrastructure so what the CBC does is actually create Canadians it's not about what's on on the thing it's the platform that matters that not the content so I mean we've always had these things like we've had radio ham radio those types of stuff and yellow journalism there's always been salacious gossip magazines The National Enquirer things like that that have always been around who develop counter narratives to dominant narratives right um they're all mediated right everything's media we're mediated by the the news we get whether it's radio I mean long history and the evangelicals have had this the the it's called the jeremiahad the fall of civilization predates the Americans there was a Canadian who used to go on the radio back in the day and say that America's Society is falling and this was a way for him to get money but also to make people very suspicious of this new American state so there's no new um nothing new about this per se little opportunity for citizens to communicate with politicians or the media and Fireside Chats were like the first propaganda when like FDR would sit on the radio and tell everybody about what was up to date so the idea of rhetoric or that people aren't passively producing information it just it I don't see any foundation for it I can't do all of his he has got a whole bunch of great videos um uh but he's talking specifically here about this idea of um of he's being accused of disinformation talking about the uh just this notion of uh slavery and the idea that people their own leaders uh were the ones who sold them into slavery as if there wasn't like active theft of people involved in the slave trade hey good morning you said not one person was stolen they were sold by their own leaders don't race bait if you're going to use this information well Brock Childers 87 I can clearly see that you're Alabaster Alabama education has failed you so come here real quick so this is a key aspect here it's we want to say that like somehow information on the Internet is going to be you know anybody can post it and so you don't know who it is but like racism and the ability to perceive and and make claims on each other about whose disinformation or misinformation it's not new right like this is not new this is a long history of this and so this idea that somehow the internet is a place where we didn't have back and forth so that we didn't have letters to the editor we didn't have you know organizations like the KKK being able to propagate their ideas we didn't have remember the KKK all the secret hand codes and everything were taken down by the radio because um uh it was in the Superman series the radio series that somebody infiltrated the KKK um I think it was a I think it was a Jewish activist infiltrated the KK got all their hand signals then went on the Superman radio show and told everybody about them so we could all spot KKK members so like this has always been there I just I don't believe this notion kind of kind of passive technology let's have a conversation first and foremost I'm gonna need you to stop lying you are far too old for that stop it secondly the lies you're telling were started by a racist Cloister of Cairns known as the United Daughters of Confederacy their job was to spread myths and disinformation about slavery in the United States of America they lied and rewrote history books making sure that they favored the South and protected racists you racists and many disinformed people say that nobody was stolen from Africa while history says this sir Admiral John so before we get into that I just want to make a comment on on this idea of dis and misinformation these claims we'll come back to it I talked about a bit before the idea of an epistemic bubble also happens so this can happen academically it can happen in academic disciplines it can happen across information it can happen online it can happen in your friend group the idea of information being politically contested being political is inherent to information and so this idea that technology would somehow and allow us to do something with that be more accurate less accurate he's talking about something that happened 100 years ago that we're still fighting about today so information is still always transmitted I don't know if you're going to be able to see this text but he's got sources is the main Hawkins hijacked a Portuguese slave ship and sold 300 Africans from it and on his second trip he captured 400 Africans he didn't buy them he didn't purchase them and he didn't trade for them he captured them so he's just providing evidence for the claim and we'll come back to this again about this idea of it's It's the acronym is crap about how to find good information versus bad information right and and and all the controversy around that it's not controversy contestation around that is a better word okay let me he I'm going to give him a bit more space to to make his arguments here and when he finished he wrote a book titled an alliance to raid for slaves and in this book he tells the story of the very first Africans they captured kidnapped and stole he writes in his book I went myself where we took 250 persons men women and children he said nothing about buying them not purchasing them not trading them he said we took 250 people and in total there were 600 prisoners and yet here you are just loud proud and wrong declaring that nobody was stolen you then go on to say that they were sold by their own leaders and that too is false Africa has the highest form of genetic diversity on the planet before white people showed up there was no we are all Africans we are all black no they were different ethnicities much like you Europeans were how you British were different from the okay we already covered that in the race stuff hey I'm going to go on just because I don't want to get too dragged down into that argument I mean the point is is that race is online race and Technology are integrated and and forms of racism and I'll talk about this later are everywhere um and so yes digital technology or interactive labs for multi-directional flow of political information so the idea here is that like the past was somehow passive about information and the present is somehow different I don't know that that that statement can hold it's it's a broad claim that doesn't have a ton of foundation in the text so the idea here is that citizens are active participants and producers of political information so we'll get into this but again this is a Chinese run platform that Americans are fighting about race on we can't lose that part of it either right um and so racism sexism misogyny teen depression self-harm etc those are all kind of consequences of society going online and and major maybe amplifying or reinforcing patterns that were already there so we have this notion of cyber optimism that sees um technology as positive and empowering for citizens okay I I don't love to use the the term here because as we talked about in the migration anyways uh gives voices to marginalized communities sure uh liberation theology is an authoritarian regimes maybe uh privity privacy security and over from oversight intrusion maybe I mean maybe if these systems are secure you could provide data like you could whistleblow right and so we we've seen that for example with a Snowden or uh Wikileaks right the idea that the technology allows us to to do new things I guess um but we have we also have their like basic principles right it's basic ideas about we could see this as positive that that this idea of Technology can reinforce for us the idea that you know we should have privacy and that we should build it into our technology that we should make sure that we are visible transparent have you know the capability to see things have security complete and privacy by default um and treat our our data as as um as a a thing that we should be concerned with but unfortunately that's probably not the case um there is some really interesting stuff coming from the fact that we just bleed data all over the place that our devices are constantly sending data out to other systems and remember the cloud is just somebody else's computer um and this book in particular focuses on the politics and and the ways in which it cuts both ways so what's really interesting about this is that this goes after Google searches as a way to tell us what people actually believe because people will say stuff all sorts of stuff you've seen this over and over you can look at Trends in I'm not going to get into it it gets pretty crass but for example in states that are tend to be very um religiously oppressive they tend to have very interesting search results when it comes to stuff they want to look at whereas it's it's less so in places that are more open and the idea here is that um what you your search history he tells you is like if you you know if you were going on Ashley Madison back in the day looking to actively have an affair clearly that data is important in all sorts of political ways and then when it's inevitably leaked which I'll talk about in a minute it raises all sorts of questions about what do we do with this data that's that's now out there right um on top of that states have have actively done this so one of the things that came out of the um the Snowden leaks um was the idea that that Canada as a Ally and partner of the five eyes Network Canada US Australia and New Zealand um and the UK they have since World War II cooperated on security and intelligence matters but one of those things that they they got and this was in the the Global Mail was that um as part of that Arrangement when Canada enters into trade talks with Brazil for example um they were having they had access sitting at the table negotiating with them with everything that was happening on the other side's phones they basically had hacked in or had access through this back-end database stuff to get access to all of the text messages going on at the trade negotiators on the other side so Canada and Brazil think they're sitting down as political equals but this technology then amplifies their capacity to to make these claims now this technology gets exposed and then um Brazil is like wait a minute we're not going to talk to you anymore and so it absolutely has all sorts of political ramifications and so cyber pessimism is seeing these digital Technologies as harmful and generating extremism um of authoritarian regimes China can actively I've got an example Here China can actively have different sets of standards for its own citizens and for what it platforms elsewhere it tends to organize and amplify extreme voices Echo chamber and epistemic Bubbles I'll talk about all of those the extreme voices is because advertising because these I mean BJ Fogg he had the center back in the day at MIT and they taught all of the the people went on to Silicon Valley about psychology social psychology how to maximize things like red notification icons to maximize things that that trigger in US emotional responses so that we will continue to engage more and more with the content right the the quick speed access to give us those dopamine hits in order to do this Tristan Harris has tons of stuff on this um and then the idea that the private sector is beyond government control and so cyber pessimism is that Facebook is interested in profit it's amoral and as a consequence of that it's going to platform whatever gives it the most money including election misinformation disinformation whatever and will say that it tries to control this stuff but probably won't unless the government mandates that they do so and we've got enough evidence now that that's the case and so it becomes data and data out the internet is dominated by white Western men in training data ethos and attitudes and this is called the Silicon Valley neophilia I've got lots of examples of this the most famous one is this this is Mark Zuckerberg saying that this was kind of the ethos of what they were doing including like like democracy they can move fast and break those things um the idea of the internet is providing Global benefit versus things like this so Global research.c I saw it in my student papers a couple years ago and I was like what is this thing it's straight dis and misinformation and it's platformed on dot CA the Canadian domain which is run by icann which is digital registrar in Canada that is monitored and controlled but at least in some extent by government regulation but it's hosted on our so I don't know whether or not Canada should take a more active role when it we don't like to do it we don't we like the idea of free speech so we don't want to get in the precedent of shutting down websites we don't like but I mean I'm I I understand the idea that it causes a problem we also have the ways in which doxing are releasing a personal information online poses all sorts of threats to people and everybody else I used to be able to pull up in class docspent um the docsman archive for a while was just sitting out there on the internet and it would have like Hillary Clinton's social security number it had Taylor Swift's phone number like all sorts of information on there that poses all sorts of privacy and security uh problems but this is the problem with these websites ashleymadison.com thing I downloaded all the data it's still on the Pirate Bay I think you can get it it's like six or eight gigabytes of data um and just went through through it looked at all the um University email addresses that were in it lots of people use their University email addresses to do this you could also go by your townships and see for example like York Region email addresses and find out who was on that website oh by the way that website for cheating was largely run uh it was like 90 male the employees were pretending to be women and the Bots were the primary people that were interacting with so there were there was almost no women on the site so they're all trying to get into relationships with Bots I don't know what that means either so all of this is to say is that this information creates these two sides of problems when we're thinking about politics and security um this idea that anybody can do anything on the internet which they're more in increases all of our vulnerability we still never know who hacked Ashley Madison why they did it um disgruntled employee is one of the the biggest Frameworks and then we have on the other side the idea that this costs or that so much 85 percent of the infrastructure for the internet is in private hands so governments want to regulate the internet but the bulk of it is in private hands which is also for them they do the guns and butter calculation for their shareholders the state does it for their citizens private companies do it for their shareholders and so they don't necessarily want to fix these things and so thinking about where this leads us is to What's called the in the kind of current moment this idea of moving towards zero trust technology because in order to get some level of security we have to assume that everything is going to get leaked or hacked at some point just try to firewall everything right we constantly reassert your identity you constantly have to reevaluate systems you don't have this idea that in here it's secure and out there it's not and so there's no Insider outside I like this and that it challenges the idea of the like territorial boundaries of the Sovereign Nation State don't think that way but at the same time I don't know as a continuous process if we create security as a verb rather than a noun we we make everybody suspicious of everybody else and I would say that that's kind of what we've ended up with with this technology online is that I think that covet in particular taught us that one there's lots of things that could be accelerated we could work from home we can use zoom we don't need to get together we don't need to meet but also we need to get together we need to meet um the the mediated space of this is not the same as reality and it's always going to distort our perceptions of self and what we can do and what we should do and all of those things so thinking about it in those terms then I don't know if we can have social relations without trust and I don't know if we can have Trust online and so this idea of how we produce a positive social I want to be a cyber Optimist but I understand the Cyber pessimist argument because it it um it there was our strong Arguments for both
