 so in the last video we talked about the kind of three dominant critiques and I want to spend a bit more time about the specifics in um the social reproduction critique of the public private because the public and private split has never really existed um social reproduction is the ways in which the private sphere is needed to reproduce um future workers and citizens women's work is vital to sustaining the economy but it's often undervalued and unpaid the easiest way is Child Care Child Care you know if you have to go and pay for somebody else to do it you know exactly how much it's worth but when you do it at home you're not compensated for it and so racially um historically racialized women had no choice but to work for others we still have all sorts of well get into this with citizenship when we get to it um we still use visas and deployment of citizenship and the recruitment of of women as a targeted group a intersectional women from around the world 2 do forms of care care work domestic work and then we could talk about trafficking and sexual sex work as well but the idea of domestic work as being a primary impetus of mechanisms of migration of strategies of visa and strategies of citizenship and so this is still the case if you look at Elder Care the ways in which we target certain communities and in very specific ways to allow them access to those forms of employment but not necessarily access to full citizenship and so that's a ways in which we deploy social reproduction as a strategy and so social reproduction is just a whole bunch of thing one how we reproduce mailpreg I really I wonder and this the question I will pose like you know for presenting men how many of you would choose to carry a child to term if you could right we tend to think about these things in binary ways but you know we've got technology we've got all sorts of technology in vitro fertilization development of Technology reproductive Technologies the artificial uterus this idea that we can we could why not right why not do these things and then see how the questions change and see how the the reproduction changes um hopefully we'll get to some discussions and menstruation later too and how the kind of politics of that are all built into this um and so the reproduction of the labor force requires substance Education and Training and then we decide who gets paid and who does what so um if we do it in this very specific ways we decide who um who the reproduction and provisioning of carrying happens and then the extent to which it's a public or private issue and so the easiest examples of this are we have all sorts of different models of social reproduction um you know these kind of old western biblical traditions of patriarchal households trade and agriculture and then using unpaid labor or literal slave labor as forms of social reproduction right feudal we have the familiar label for the Lord taxation substance but like both familiar labor for the feudal was both men and women and the kids everybody was involved in the Victorian we get the scientific reproduction of gendered Labor so as I talk about in the glossary we take things like Midwifery and we take it away from women's and we force them into the house and we say that that medicine and science has control over reproductive work and that we should make decisions not good decisions just make decisions mercantilism Imperial Conquest fortism we reproduce a special post-war this idea of assembly lines and this kind of re this this work that requires unpaid women's work specifically the post-war taking women who worked at assembly lines and then coming up with all these systems why they're supposed to go back to unpaid work when they were working on assembly lines during the war um but we do things like public schooling State capacity so we expand social benefits social welfare and then we have all sorts of ways in which we allow corporations to provide or not provide those forms of work and then we get the post-war nuclear family this idea of of you know women in the home males having an income that allows them to sustain the entire family with female unpaid home labor that's a regulatory of uh notion of this and then we can talk about this kind of post nuclear family what we have now is that people assemble and that we're moving back to intergenerational families because housing is so expensive and so when we think about private sphere as being political about social reproduction um the state is absolutely always concerned with social reproduction it's concerned with this it's why we do the census it's why we do this so we can establish policies that encourage or discourage forms of social reproduction we like or don't like want or don't want see is valuable or not um so the idea of the ways in which we change um social reproduction is how we societally establish how long and how far apart people should have uh children the time between these the length of pregnancy in terms of what is the social conception of how like this um uh paternity maternity or parental leave is a notion of how long care should take right and so if you go on Parental leave for a specific amount of time the state regulates in the the states is three days or something or if your company regulates it's two months that's a form of regulating how much time you get to spend and how much you get to take in terms of pregnancy um and then it how we regulate those things and how the state is involved with it and you know in the Scandinavian countries you get five thousand dollars when you get pregnant you get all this these uh these things the in the French system you know you can have In-Home Care all the ways in which we produce or encourage or discourage pregnancy um also things like fetal mortality which shutting down things like access to reproductive capabilities which has been happening in the states as a direct correlation of the decreasing rates of of um maternal and Fetal mortality for marginalized communities in the U.S we've seen it we've seen this study even under Trump we've seen it shoot up that areas where we shut down Planned Parenthood result in all sorts of other health complications that don't have to do with direct access to Reproductive Rights they have everything to do with the broader framework of of health and reproduction and then their presence or absence of birth control has all sorts of ways in which we do this and so the length of time can be adjusted by cultural factors how when you wean children and cultural taboos over sex and breastfeeding what's the normal length of time and so this is Time Magazine kind of doing some of this stuff that's her three-year-old what's the length this is these type of cultural norms become ones that we regulate and talk about and think about as cultural attitudes just breastfeeding and the ways in which Nestle has a gross history of targeting communities specifically black communities with free formula when the kids are first born as ways to make sure that they can't breastfeed and they get become dependent on forms of Revenue and wealth and so all of these cultural Notions are Reaper uh about reproductive ages have changed how migration male migration or female migration changes the the country that has the migration happen or doesn't happen not all migrating populations have high birth rates for whatever reason the French Canadian birth rates after settlement dropped dramatically so that almost 8 million French Canadians are are descended from 1400 women so communities within communities can be the source of the reproduction of that Society or not and then we could have the broader question about settler societies and birth rates about in what ways or birth rates forms of social reproduction and social settlement right um social reproduction is also economic issue um if the cost of raising children is low you'll generally tend to have more but if it's more expensive you'll have less we we have lots of evidence of this this is happening in in South Korea in the U.S and Canada um in recessions or when cost of living is to a high birth rate struck and that Social Security both children as a value of Social Security and as the absence of it so if your state has Social Security you don't need to have children in order to have somebody to care of you when you're older they don't have it you do and so there's cultural religious factors that all comes into this and it's the wealth flows theory that social reproduction happens when Society is doing well and when it's not people will minimize their family size and so we have these ways in which the family is intimately connected to social regulation to participation about who participates in this hetero patriarchal uh framing of the social contract the state has all sorts of ways it can intervene encourage or discourage forms of these things happening having non-um having um not having minimum wages that allow you to live by yourself having the livable wages that allow you to to live by yourself the capacity of Social Security to make things cheap the cultural and social attitudes towards reproduction states can adopt all sorts of attitudes but if society and culture rejects it it won't happen and so gender Dynamics are are intimately linked to social reproduction and the status of women is directly linked to fertility and population growth the capacity to um to deal with unwanted pregnancies the likelihood of maternal death all of those things factor into the choices made around social reproduction um yeah these are just more examples of the Erasure of the ways in which people choose to live or not live in the ways in which society says they should or shouldn't live um and so the private sphere is always political who gives care how they give care and how they're remunerated for their care is deeply political and so we remained it in this sexual contract gender normativity around these kind of gender polls matters exclusion is still rampant and will remain so because we are all implicated in forms of normativity and claims for justice about whether we're conscious of them or not and that Consciousness itself represents the ability to challenge gender normativity because if you don't even know what you're challenging you're not going to be able to challenge
