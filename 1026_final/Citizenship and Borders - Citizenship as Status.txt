 okay so citizenship would seem straightforward except it really isn't um it's the idea of formal status within a national state but it becomes really complicated really quick because your status then determines your rights and obligations and I'm not talking about people whatever I'm talking about what Hannah Arendt talked about she said that after World War II when they drew the lines of the borders around Europe there were a whole bunch of people who ended up on the wrong side of a line through no fault of their own and so the idea then is is it's not that and she very specifically says borders created refugees not the other way around right so the idea of making something where you've got status then when that line is drawn the people who are on the right side of the line who the state designates and recognizes as being read on that sideline then get rights but if you are one who the state doesn't designate um you don't get right so this has happened a bunch of times to talk about it in the the book a bit um where states have tried to say well we're going to revoke this person's citizenship um we're going to send them back to a state where we think they come from and that other state I don't know who that is so what happens to those people they literally don't have they also don't have anybody to protect their rights so it becomes this very precarious situation is that um this has happened at the past and this is largely what the emergence of the concentration camp with the boa war was the idea that that people are in a space that is controlled by someone where they don't have any rights and so this idea then is that it's both a limited and exclusionary state has the ability to Grant citizenship and interact with it so you have a right to freely travel but the state is under no obligation to give you a passport so good luck with that right it's and so the implementation of your your rights is always going to be determined based on whether or not you know that state has decided you have a status now for me to Grant you this that or the other and so um you know this border is critical in every sense because who is inside and outside of it then matters in in terms of these so it's an interesting concept of like what citizenship is if you don't interact with the state and so like back in you know what is that 1989 most Americans like less than 10 percent of Americans had a passport it wasn't until you know the last what is that 10 years where you even have 30 with the passport which is to say then your citizenship status was never really in question per se if you were a settler group that had long-standing ties and relationships in a community because in many cases you would need the the referent point so you might have a birth certificate and you might have a Social Security number and those things might result in you having a driver's license or you could have just went and got a driver's license before they required those things right remember credit we could get into this the racialized stuff of credit credit ratings didn't exist in the 80s you had a job you go into a bank you say I want a house they give you a loan right like they didn't do this kind of deep background stuff a lot of stuff was based on status where your your respect in the community is what established things um it drives me nuts whenever I'm doing reference letters and they ask for your full legal name your full legal name is whatever the hell you make it and this is well established in law it goes back to some like guy who went around I don't know his name was was butch or something and everybody knew him as Butch and so some bank got an agreement where it didn't have Butch on the title like well this isn't the loan I don't owe you any money blah blah blah and they took him to court it's like no it's what's reasonable right if everybody knows you as something that's your name that's your legal name for all intents and purposes so to try to to try to make status something more complicated than that it's it's what is reasonable in a court of law right um and so you could do this over and over again this is you know your citizenship it did why don't if you want a passport you have to pass a citizenship test if you don't have to do that to get a passport what is your proof of citizenship and why is it that we have a higher threshold for those who want status than those who have it and so like you could do this just you click that link and go to it see if you pass a citizenship test and this is one of the what are the responsibilities of citizenship getting a job making money raising family paying taxes mowing your lawn voting elections voting Municipal options joining political party getting a job obeying the law drawing safely picking up later caring for the environment not littering paying taxes obeying while helping others respecting others all those sound reasonable but obeying the law taking responsibility for oneself and one's family helping others in the community voting and elections serving on a jury protecting and enjoying our heritage environment you got it right can we disqualify people who've never served on a jury I've never served on a jury so I is it that I'm capable of serving on a jury is that what does it and so this is the problem is that we have real struggles when it comes to defining we can say the word that when we have to implement it it becomes very messy it's a slippery concept we still not entirely sure what it means and this idea we we don't have it it was Paul Martin senior that introduced the bill that that we have it in 1946 well we were a settler State long before that listen back in the day there there was no official border between Canada and the U.S not there was a formal line but like people if the the economy was bad in like Wisconsin they come over and get a job in Canada and people in Canada when the economy is bad in Canada they go over to Wisconsin like there wasn't any effort to establish like if you lived in a community you can establish your community Through reciprocal relationships with others there oh they know that guy I know who he is right so those things get established through forms of like you can call that a background check but it's not really right um so we still are struggling to describe what it means to be a citizen I don't know why I don't have to pass tests when I get a passport I know people have pest tests they want to be a citizen so if I want citizenship should I have best test seems pretty simple I mean basic kind of I don't know if we have standards for people that we say this is what it means to be us then why don't we have to follow those standards right it's it's like we're we're literally grandfathered in right so and even that concept of being grandfathered in I don't know anyways so because the slippery concept um what category categorizes inclusion exclusion or Community um is uh largely social and then comes with all the problems I mean I I will not I'm not going to deal with kids and cages at the borders because I find it emotionally overwhelming and it's not it's so emotionally overwhelming we can't have a reasonable discussion over it I've got lots of examples of like former veteran U.S Marines who have their driver's license on them in Michigan get picked up as illegals and deported even though they have their like their veterans card and their driver's license on them it's bureaucracy the instantly introduced some type of bureaucracy you can blame the bureaucracy when the bureaucracy doesn't function and so this idea of having a right also requires the government to enforce that right and enforce it in a way that doesn't reflect power and privilege good luck with that um and so there's full participation in practice is kind of limited um it's been a case you can still do it in the U.S if you are um or if you're not a full citizen you can participate in you can join the American Military and then apply for full citizenship you were told you would get it it's never quite as simple as that um Starship Troopers has this as a premise it it's an interesting parody fascist movie um but one of the premises is you're you don't get full citizenship status until you serve in the military which is an interesting concept right that that there has to be some ways in which you participate so if we trace it back to ancient Greece and Rome we already as we talked throughout the course those people who have through the division of labor were of such higher status that they thought they could rule and and be ruled right participate in ruling um so one who has ruled and ruled um and so we know the citizenship from its Inception in this framework in the western tradition has been about excluding uh women slave foreigners and Resident aliens right um it's framed as a civic duty of Elites and so it's always always done this um the citizenship as rights informed by 17th century liberalism American French revolutions tries to establish an equality fraternity and Liberty as the basis but we still have gender and race as an impediment to both of those so if we're going to do this this if we're going back to these origins of the ruler and the ruled it means you would think citizenship means you have to participate in a political process so why don't we do things like Australia where you're fined if you don't vote or put like real penalties on your lack of participation in the process or if you're not going to do it then you lose some citizenship right so we don't really understand why it is that these different systems say the same word when they Implement them radically different right um you know is it easy to be obligated um is it is it better to have leisure time than have to participate politically I you know you will might get this but those of us who do politics can be kind of insufferable about politics not everybody wants to to think through these citizenship obligations and I don't know if everybody should I don't know if we want to referendum on every issue I I think it'd be exhausting and I'm not sure we do that hence we there's got to be some dynamics of representation I just don't know what they should look like now the problem of this framework is is this idea of known genealogy so for the longest time in France your social status was your citizenship you you were known by others and you could be acknowledged by others and and treated as someone of respect and that was what granted you citizenship so you generally had a known genealogy so you have to have social ranking you're a patriarch a warrior and then literally a master of the labor of others normally slave is the model of our system now this still exists in our system what the hell is a senate in the U.S it gives equal representation to California which is the fourth biggest economy in the world and Wisconsin which has what like 50 000 people in it it's a totally inequitable structure we have the same thing here the the Canadian Senate which Trudeau said we were going to get rid of which I never did um the Canadian Senate is very much this model it's the idea that you are appointed into a role that oversees and puts checks and balances on this system um It's Not Elected right um and so when we problematize the citizenship far enough this is where I just ran into this is the citizenship book from MIT press not some wonky press this is MIT in 2019. and they use the arguments here citizenship has always been explicitly exclusionary hierarchical sexist and uh racist I mean yeah if you want to put that fight a point on it um violent totalitarian and pre-modern pre-modern is interesting here and so it it is carryover and there's a whole bunch written on this and a whole bunch even the authors used in this chapter this week um that are referenced have written extensively on this um because it's capricious and random in its assignment which means you can't get it based on Merit per se um it actually doesn't have that we've got the data I'll show it in a second but it's less than three three percent ever change citizenship in their lifetime so you what you get when you're born is what you get it's through no fault of your own it's just wherever you happen to be born right um it's a glory uh glory in its sexism and racism well I mean it has this long tradition of those who have the right to make decisions um and it's the opposite of political answer emancipation because it is assigned to you and it's very hard if not impossible to change or get rid of right um and so you can do it that way or you could do it as a story of belonging um this idea that it reinforces individualism statehood dignity equality and human worth if you if you have that so back to what that that test was saying about what citizenship should be um these are just this that's the egality Liberty egalitarian fraternity right so the principles of it in the social contract theory which is still a lot what we use we've talked about before but it's this idea of this consensual and contractual relationship that there this idea of citizens consent is the basis of political Authority the problem of course is is that we know that citizens weren't everyone um and that's still the case so I'll just give you the case a Doha we can talk about a minute but 80 of the population that lives in Doha at any given time goes up and down and prior to the World Cup it was much higher um the bulk of the population in the country doesn't have citizenship like 80 doesn't because they're foreign workers right um and so this idea then that the people who participate to the economy of the country don't have citizenship very much is in this long line of tradition right and it's a pretty simple claim because if your Qatari you can just say they're not Qatari they're South Asian and normally Indian or Pakistani and you just say that they're not us and done I'm not obligated to them they don't get rights whatever right and so this is this weird um Foundation that we elect representatives delegate Powers abide by their decisions um but they should ultimately be responsible to us but that's only if we've got mechanisms by which to do that right and so citizenship as rights then um isn't automatic from these systems of governance so the systems of governance we have in place are from much older models part of the reason that we are able to fully participate in our political systems that we're full citizens now has to do with like things like World War one where what throws us into World War One are a series of packs made in secret by leaders who are not accountable in any way to their populist Kings and and leaders and all the rest of it and then everyone's thrown into war and thrown into war like not because you had any say in the process but in the case of Canada Canada was part of the BNA act so Canada did not have the capacity to set independent foreign policy in World War One and so when Britain declares war Canada is at War and then the Canadian population gets conscripted into war so you are twice removed from having any say in this system and so in World War one we've got 625 000 serving World War II at 1.1 million serving we have a population 12 million this is a massive contribution that in the first case they didn't have any choice over we had literal riots in 1917 because in particular the french-speaking population of Canada is like what like you're conscripting us for a war for the Brits like what's going on here and so the democratization of foreign policy the textbook frames it as happening after World War II you've just basically trained your entire populace and how to fight and they come back and then you try to say like you've been through Horrors and we're gonna make those decisions without you no and so this is that tradition right so all of those people in World War one and two fought and died under this flag that under a British flag which is you have citizenship but not kind of yours kind of not right like you're you're part of the Commonwealth and so you are citizens of the queen that doesn't have a full say or autonomy over your decisions and decision making so this idea then is is shifting from a citizen model that is is bestowed on you from a monarch to a citizen model where you have rights and obligations as Citizens in that state emerges largely post-world War II and so it's just this idea that you have to have we have to be able to to have some individual freedom and to do that we need some type of civil rights like I should be able to vote right um especially if I'm being asked to if I'm being taxed like I should have some form um you should have some political rights the right to vote and run for office um and then um social rights and so this is really post World War II like I like to frame it in the reverse they're like these were granted by the state I'm like well you've got a populist that you just sent off to war they just came back and they're pretty clear on what Warfare is maybe you shouldn't um kick them while they're down you know so this raises interesting questions this this came up in in this period this was one of the proposed after World War one around World War One this idea of the Ludlow amendment in the U.S was that uh wait a minute if if you've got conscription or you're asking us to go to war shouldn't we have a referendum on Declarations of War except in cases where you've been attacked first right if if the state is choosing to go to war and I'm the one who literally has to go to war shouldn't you do that um there was also like an offshoot which is like if you vote for war should that member that representative immediately be conscripted into Warfare too like if you're willing to do it you're willing to put us on the line you should do that now all this has changed with professional armies and there isn't the same obligation but this idea of citizenship as rights is like well no why do we get rights and why do some get rights and some don't and so this idea of of Law and Parliament like co-opting this participation adds this social Dimension to rights and so social rights gain prominence Canada Post World War II just not randomly like this idea that you fought and died for this country um probably means that country should should take care of you right like at a basic level like I think we need to massively expanded veterans rights it will cost Canadians money but you should probably do that because you've asked for things and if you're asking them to do that and you're expecting unlimited liability like they're putting their life on the line probably should get better benefits than you know working somewhere else right um anyways neither here nor there uh so so adding this social Dimension to citizenship then brings in all these other questions right because if you're providing Goods then you're saying that we are designating certain groups for certain things and other groups maybe not getting as many things especially if they don't have citizenship in the case let's just do it indigenous communities you know the the right to vote right until 75. um you're still got residential schools operating until the 90s so this idea then of public education universal healthcare public um housing income Security Programs absolutely are distributed um their your ability to access them is very much tied into your citizenship um in the Canadian case this was become a marker of identity right so our social Provisions our Universal Health Care is tied to the Canadian identity why in 2004 Tommy Douglas voted Canada's greatest Canadian that's why there's a large allergic reaction to the privatization of health care because we see it as American right we see it as an undermining of the Canadian the distinct Canadian identity which at some level the only thing we have is this now there are states in the US that actually have it it's this they don't have it at the federal level that's Tommy Douglas so um citizenship as status then raises a bunch of questions um who is born a citizen and who can has the right to access citizenship um how should we think about it um how do we think about migration this question isn't really unpacked I I like this this is from the readings I did these are more concrete examples so citizenship has status then um is the status of fully belonging to any Community it used to be assigned strictly and for Life the instances of purses being coming naturalized or converting across the world is less than two percent so this is a largely entrenched hierarchical uh non-merit-based system um because 98 of citizenship never changes it just doesn't um even if you look at all the migration they put the numbers like oh if you look at a percentage like three percent right um and so it's a signed at Birth not chosen and will be remain unchanged for life so this stuff like this happens right guitar citizenship allows the majority um to uh justify this 88 it was 88 of foreign workers the majority to do this to oppress these foreign workers because they're foreign workers they don't have full status they don't have full rights they don't get the full protections of the state they don't have the same coverages and they the state can designate because they're not from here and which they they are right I used to work at York in um in financial services and one time one of the higher ups came and I just I had to do I was doing the website for the prices for domestic and international students I'm like well how are we setting the international students well I said whatever I want uh whatever sounds reasonable let's round the numbers up let's do it that way right like totally arbitrary where there's all sorts of legislation on how specifically you calculate it for those who are domestic when those are interested you know whatever we'll make it up so here's an example of one um so he's born his parents took him when he was three months old um uh to Minnesota he's never left Minnesota he has continually been there all the time and he has two sisters who were born there um who have full citizenship rights because they're born in the U.S um he has no right to remain in the U.S and every interaction he has where someone can question his status is potential his deportation to a place he has no relationship to has never been to and can be arbitrarily taken out whenever he just happens to run into the wrong person so in terms of Rights they are conferred by your state to you so both of his sisters have full rights but he doesn't this is 2.3 million people in the U.S are living in this status right so this is why status is the word all the time because he has overtly done nothing specifically that he is responsible for because you cannot hold I mean we should not hold babies responsible we should not make toddlers stand in court and defend themselves put that as happy anyways I said I wouldn't talk about kids and cages gets me too upset anyways the idea here is that person has made no overt act at any point in their life to do anything but participate in the community in which they're born lived and raised or Not Sorry lived and raised not born um and as a consequence of that then they're at constant threat of deportation to a place they've never never encountered right so their full rights in that Society are always going to be constrained by a decision that wasn't theirs this in any other context would be be a punishment without proper adjudication of a crime which under a liberal Society shouldn't happen right but because you're not in that liberal Society it can happen to you and so this is a long history right so dust in the Dutch East Indies if these women were marrying Colonial people even as Dutch they lose their status they didn't have the right to return When Yugoslavia collab if you didn't inform the Slovenian state of where you were they don't have any record of you you don't live there and so it's changed a bit but in the past so under George W bush I just know this data um the bulk of uh illegal immigrants in the U.S where Visa overstays which meant they undertook no overt action to to create the situation where they if you want to call the criminal criminal but they didn't take any overt acts so there was no intent on their part often this is Visa delays processing bureaucracy slows down or they don't have the right status so you could say that their inability to choose that stuff but if they don't make an overt act normally crimes require an action and intent and if you don't have intent how can you be a crime so this is why many well some have argued that you can't and George W bush argued that um illegal Crossing of a border wasn't a ongoing issue because the threat to people who are framed as criminal so he or Georgia Bush argued that crossing the border wasn't an ongoing act it's like speeding if you speed are you forever a speeder and should you constantly be under threat that the state has a picture of you speeding and if they encounter you at any point they can dig up that picture and say we're throwing you in jail for you not reporting your speeding so we don't have it as an ongoing status that was changed after George W um and let's be clear deportation shut way up under Obama um Obama would love to deport people and drawing people um and so this idea um as and though it's presented as equal citizenship is never and not it cannot be neutral it always plays in the world of the policing of boundaries around the state if I am threatened that I'm in a constant state like that if I interact with police or health care or any official and that official asks for my citizenship status and then I'm immediately deported that is going to make sure that I can't fully participate in that Society um it's a Perpetual problem part of the reason the the don't ask don't tell stuff was around is that people for example would get diseases or encounter violent situations or see crimes and couldn't report them and so what it creates is basically citizenship where the social is existing and then bigger and bigger black markets right because because we Don't Legalize It right and so this famously has been called a Birthright Lottery you uh you you basically hit a lottery when you're born the ticket places you in first class business economy or outside the plane by no overt action of your own you are a baby you can't do anything about it and we can actually quantify the differences here so there's a Q and I index that talks about the value of nationality so you can just uh relate it so you can put it all together so citizenship has status we can quantify it and rank them so if you you count human development economic strength peace and stability uh the Democratic and socioeconomic Freedom the uh capacity the the weight of uh what is that self-effective freedom the capacity to travel and the weight of travel if you put them together you get a rank and so the us on this ranking is 25th and Canada was 28th we are off the top of the list and so this idea that citizenship grants you all of these things just and we understand why right like if you're a good Syrian Refuge you try to get to Germany because these have having citizenship there gives you all sorts confers all sorts of benefits that are just where you were born and nothing else and so citizenship as status then is this spectrum of those who are born into places that have a lot of capabilities and resources because wherever they were born and those who don't have that status are in constant threat of being deported back to one of those lesser ranked places and so we do this all the time we differ types of citizenship and types of status here migrant workers I see them all the time migrant workers come up they get the benefit of access to more income but they don't have all sorts of other benefits that come from Full citizenship and so they can't do as many things and they can't make as many claims and they can't demand as much stuff right not only that we have a point space system that privileges education marketable skills and language and income as ways in which you can go to the top of the queue in terms of getting status and so it's not a merit-based system it is a system that we change at our Leisure as to which of the best people around the world best we have to do it it's normative the best people around the world that we want here it goes to those more substantive questions about how to settler settlers have the right to um to close the border right like you got to come here at some point until 19 what was it whatever it was when we just find citizenship you got to come here and you got status and then we decided oh everybody is here get status and then let's close the border behind us and I'll unpack some of the problems of doing it that way um just this idea of in a settler Society closing a border is weird and so we live in a World's as a status citizenship is illiberal it goes against the idea it's landed it's the whole premise of moving from feudalism to liberalism this is the radical stuff I was talking about before was that it takes um established inherited wealth and puts it into a productive system Taxation and representation and moving out of the class system and into a market-based system was a radical framing remember capitalism was Radical because it said we're going to take those resources make them productive for our economy and make the economy bigger and everybody benefit and so the idea of having untaxed inherited wealth and the reason we still have inherited tax is the idea that it creates an illiberal Society where not everybody puts into reasonable production the capacities of that Society to undermine Society so our world today is still one where the place we were born and live and matters enormously determine as much as two-thirds of our lifetime income um and so that less than two percent that actually switches means that 98 of us get a huge amount of and this is the birthright Lottery untaxed inheritance in the status of our um citizenship and you know this is the kid because it's it's you can measure there's all sorts of things that measure which which passport's the best to have which citizenship's the best to have and so this idea of framing citizenship as a universal experience is largely framing it as an illiberal experience not one where we say those who work are the hardest and get ahead get benefit to it no it's those who have it have it and those who don't don't and that's just how we framed it and so if you want to talk about settlement I mean where would you settle it looks like our those other countries look like better places but there's no capacity to change it's either you have it or you don't someone in your family has it you can apply for it or you don't and so it's about birth it's a Birthright Lottery
