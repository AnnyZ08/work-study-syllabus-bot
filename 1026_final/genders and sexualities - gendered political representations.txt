 so I mean the binary becomes this weird kind of Trope for thinking about this chapter um sure we can argue transgender and queer people's rights beyond the binary or we could just argue people's rights um we need to articulate the claims but we need to have this problem of this chapter being okay right like this is it and and we don't and I've got examples of this like uh I'll just record for the glossary um it's the comedian I forgot her name uh she's got a bunch of slasher anyways she just says look it you want to look at who um the bulk of people who are doing forms of mass shootings in the states men why don't we restrict their rights to guns Just men's rights to guns so then everybody has those rights to guns we just restrict them on men and this idea then of targeting groups because of their association with something is is this idea of specifically this privilege right the privilege faced so there are all sorts of barriers that formal politics create both tacitly explicitly and then in moral Panic against communities that have faced this forever in the cases two-spirit individuals that face this as long as settlement has been going on um and so they become the target for discriminatory policies and laws by federal and provincial government so just the removal of Rights right there I mean the simple one is is the partnership rights or rights rights to reproduce to adopt to get benefits survivor benefits grieve um have access to pensions basic things right like basic things about people that we partner with or relationships that we establish um and so we have all sorts of laws that are vaguely about these Notions about um what type of Acts are acceptable but they don't even make a ton of sense um as I was talking about before because people engage in stuff all the time all over the place that you know there was a proliferation there and specifically in the states of lawmakers who were passing these types of of uh laws were persistently getting caught engaging in the very thing they're passing laws against right um but there is a very clear and established well-established historical harm specifically around federal jobs for um any members of the lgbtq community there are some weird ways in which that produces any efforts to regulate bodies in this way is going to produce all sorts of weird outcomes that aren't logically consistent or don't even make sense right um denial of marriage and spousal benefits the ability to adopt children or you know donate blood because that one was an issue up to um I think it was 2022 I I was having to have um uh members of parliament come into my class and we would say to them what's going on here um and they're just it's just these ways in which these institutional decisions get carried over and people don't want to be the ones seen dismantling the institution because it costs something politically and so rights are all bound up in what decision was made in the past even it was a dumb decision because in the present we don't want to use the social capital the resources in order to change those decisions there is also an absence of intercept intersex discussion here a little bit earlier I'll put it in the glossary of the Oprah video I reference all the time just talking about the ways in which gender is oppressive um and this like just this idea of like just people have to use the social Factory going to the washroom just just keep your nose out of other people's business like it's it's not that hard but this goes back to Rawls and this idea of Tolerance like what kind what does tolerate mean right what does liberal tolerance mean we have to establish a better basis for establishing social normativity or the lack of thinking about how dominant groups are always going to say you can't do that because you're not this right um and so we have the underrepresentation of let's say all of these communities that we're talking about in electoral publics but but women in particular we can we can Target it as a large lump group um in types of the electoral system I worked on the Ontario campaign to push for proportional representation back and then when was that well early 2000s uh some of my YouTube videos are still out there I just designed the videos I didn't wasn't in them or anything um proportional representation so over certain groups of society should get automatic seats you get to put forward who gets those automatic seats but they should do that we've got those we've got lots of experiments with proportional representation and throughout the world hit and miss it's still representation uh hostile uh public opinion towards modern politics in the glossary you talk about this the male gaze and the ways in which these ideas are reproduced in in Us in each other and then even the expectation of leadership right so gendered Notions of leadership reproduce in women what a leader looks like and then When leaders don't look like that or they don't look in the way that we expect from leaders then we say that they're not legitimate their leadership isn't legitimate um we have bias and sexist media coverage of of let's be clear men and women candidates because then we try to reproduce these these Norms um parties as Gatekeepers absolutely that's what a political party is right it's supposed to organize and solidify a coherent strategy for electoral politics but you'll deal with that in the next term Politics as an old boys club um was all Elite societies all forms of professional organizations back to the discussion where mental hygiene mental health history it was about this idea of expertise and that expertise is the boundary between the in-group and the out group one of the most dominative groups is is these old boys clubs right um stereotypes of of let's be clear people as emotional and irrational so that men get characterized in this way too if they're excessively emotional in ways that isn't understood in this kind of this this aggressive culture in Canadian politics this is what Cynthia Weber calls both conscious and unconscious ideologies we talk about consciousness ideologies all the time but gender ideologies tend to be unconscious ideologies because we participate them in our social Factory right the ways in which we produce so so even things like conservatism produces this idea of a classless society as it is advocated by certain classes of study English people are white everyone and I know is straight are ways in which they do this um this is why like they're not even stereotypes they're kind of delusions because we don't have any evidence of this what we do is we we cherry pick the evidence um that reinforces the ways in which we think these things and so rationality emotions are framed as as advanced civilized and rational I don't have a ton of evidence of populists being rational or well reasonable um what we do is we we pray we paint with broad brushes and we hope that that covers enough to be explanatory without being accurate right and the ways in which we produce indigenous peoples as the as the opposite this goes back to zootopia right so you can be civilized or uncivilized and if you're um emotional or unreasonable you're seen as as dangerous but as if you're civilized non-civilized you're you're outside the bounds um white women as emotional and passive black women um as emotional angry the tropes there's a whole bunch of tropes angry black women there's a Trope that's deployed all over the place the regulation of emotion is a Kia aspect here we're talking a hush child has done tons of work on this the ways in which we regulate emotion societies decide which emotions are okay or Howard Dean Yeehaw famously him doing a Yeehaw got him kicked out of the presidential race he was seen as as unelectable after that and so the idea then is that anger privilege is is really just reserved for already privileged groups groups that are already privileged and can rile up that anger in others um let's be clear I mean advertising driven social media pays for the most outlandish and extreme examples it's why flat earthing can be a thing because everybody thinks it's funny until everybody is is dealing with it in a semi-ironic way and then they're dealing with it they forgot about the irony and then they're fully believing the amplification of extremes is built in to the lack of a mainstream media mainstream media I don't know if there ever was a mainstream media but what we would call Mainstream media produced a liberal consensus about this is what we should watch it was much easier when there was three channels on TV where everybody watched the same thing the proliferation of the internet and advertising driven media has resulted in these Echo Chambers these rabbit holes these places in which we don't interact with other ideas and so we create these feedback loops of delusion right and how we do these things and so um uh politics and Society I would say remains hostile aggressive towards women and racialized people that just I mean whatever the hell Twitter is now is yes and so it amplifies and can amplify those spaces and make them more important than they would be for for people um and the ways in which we remember and don't remember people and the history that we create for people and so AOC is targeted so Alexandria um okay Cortez AOC um is look at me just white up at me um is framed in the textbook as this example um but I I think we probably need to be a little more critical about the ways in which it's deployed and not deployed at certain points in time I you know a sitting president or presidential candidate mocking somebody with a disability isn't disqualifying but um you know showing the wrong emotion is tripping on a bicycle I I don't know um it's it's weird how we do these things I we want to lump them in in order to have a clear explanatory framework because we know that gender normativity exists I just think that if we look too closely it starts falling apart
