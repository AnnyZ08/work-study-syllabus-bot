 so as I've tried to do throughout and the textbook does as well to think about the ways in which our Concepts our scientific expertise Concepts this kantian or hegelian concepts are um continue to be taught but are often done without their their colonial context or the ways in which those ideas contribute to kind of what's called race thinking or the ways in which hierarchy is embedded in the Norms in which we assume and so you get Concepts like Western Civilization or things like that that are produced or development the idea that that we have a scientific understanding of this thing even though we don't and then we can use that in order to push our understanding as the right one even when that's just based on hierarchy not necessarily some scientific foundation and so that's the the move the decolonizing move is to re-situate these thinkers in their context so that we can understand their ideas as a product of their time and not as universal ideals right not as absent subject positioning and so these ideas are largely used to promote promote white normativity and racial classifications that are interwoven and how we think about these things to justify Empire building we were watching the previous video on on this idea of trying to establish a geographic characteristic for race we we do a similar thing when we talk about geopolitics as if the idea that things happen in a certain place means they must happen that way as if there aren't ways in which politics emerge all over the planet in in many different ways and they don't conform to where they are just because a dominant group is able to run China doesn't mean that there's not a flourishing of different uh groups and attitudes and opinions within China that reflect as many attitudes and opinions as we have here we just don't seek them out and we don't hear them and if we don't hear them we assume they don't exist right and that's the way in which it produces this and so the idea of Empire Building colonialism elimination of indigenous people black enslavement has all been either absent through ignorance or um is produced in such a way that it's framed as in the past right we just basically started doing some of this analysis and so this idea of race thinking of of recognizing the ways in which white settler Society is part of either the identity of all of the experience here is a way to situate thought rather than just produce it uncritically right the idea of uh racial and racist racist typologies are produced and reproduced by the state and universities all the time um and then it's just a question of do we allow like do I think about those subject positions do I think about what I'm doing do I think about what it means for me to easily participate in something and that the ways in which there's higher increasing exclusions embedded in it or just choose not to right just choose my ignorance so choosing ignorance is often easier easier for people in positions of authority and power um the ways in which we have political leaders and public policies that choose ignorance is is this decision to remake our society and our practices um specifically by deploying it as normal as normal and so we've got an example of this in a minute but this is you know the idea that we Herald the the Underground Railroad as kind of Canada's position without thinking of the ways in which we have Jim Crow in the Canadian railroad and the ways in which Asian bodies are are disposably used in order to construct the Canadian national railroad the ways in which residential school system perpetuated education was a key aspect of killing The Indian in the child education was that key because we knew that education was a way to get inside people's minds and make them think against their bodies right and so this pursuit of a white Canada policy large in the 60s I think we can go later than that I mean I think the last residential school closed in 91 right um and so the idea of immigration as being framed in terms of of the stock that we want the exclusion the explicit exclusion of Asians black indigenous peoples from citizenship and voting rights and then we have Stephen Harper this is in 2015. this is the last prime minister talking about this during a debate with Trudeau it's right here let's try and bring it back to the economy yeah well let me just correct the record on a couple things refugees are about the economy David said about refugees first of all the fact of the matter is we did not we have not taken away Health Care from immigrants and refugees on the contrary the only time we've removed it is where we have clearly bogus Refugee claimants who have been refused and turned down we do not offer them a better health care plan than the ordinary Canadian can receive I think that's something and existing and and Old Stock Canadians agree with so I don't know if you caught it there but he said Old Stock Canadians can agree with and so old stock Canadians is versus the new stock Canadians because he sees it as fundamentally different right he frames it as fundamentally different so this is not on Stephen Harper it he you know we he said that you might think that I don't really care I'm not interested in litigating it what I am interested in litigating is the way in which race thinking is part of those discussions it's part of who is an acceptable migrant who who is a valid you hear him say valid Refugee claimant the ways in which we adjudicate whether or not bodies deserve whatever it is they have or whatever it is they can get about you know what could this idea of population what is the Canadian population how should it grow who should be in it right is a constant rethinking about who belongs here and so Vickers and Isaac have a book um which is just the politics of the Canadian state which is states make race and race make States specifically in Canada U.S Australia New Zealand it's specific a part of the policy we have a curtailment on non-white migration largely up to and still in certain ways to the present about who can get in which refugees get in which crises allow those refugees to be claimants and how we prioritize certain communities because they look like us or they act like us or they speak the way we do over other communities that don't right and so that's thinking about how Canadians think of themselves Who belongs and who should belong and so there there's stories and discourses that are hidden from political science because we like to think of the abstract and not the specific and so we have a bunch of different ways in which political science is engaged in these ways of thinking um this idea of the two founding races framework which is just this notion of that we have an English and French tradition that we just obliterate the other experiences and traditions that come along with it that we have this race and ethnicity discussion the conflation of these two things so that we don't have to think race and then which obviously results in denial so that this idea the race question goes back to this two race theory of Canada um it's persistent it's why we still have bilingualism and not trilingualism it's this notion that these two founding Frameworks serve as the the idea of Canadian culture that those two languages allow anyone to participate in dominant Canadian culture and so I don't know I I think it's my um daughter is is taking French right now um in grade nine and I don't know um Grade 9 French I I'm not going to say it's bad I'm just going to say why don't we have if we're doing all this reconciliation if we are doing this reconciliation if we're doing land acknowledgments we're doing all the rest of that why don't we have to you know learn the language upon which we we s we settle you think that that would be there that's the premise of French and English is that we're settled and if you want to settle you should speak one of those languages in dominant discourse in public but the idea then is that why aren't we doing the next step right and so this two founding races is a a productive myth because it it produces the idea that white European settlement is the valid Foundation of political agency and Authority it's what makes up the the Canadian State the nation state it's the Erasure the active Erasure the ongoing Erasure you tell me what the Canada flag is the ongoing Erasure of indigenous Traditions produced in some absent white ignorant ahistorical framing of how this functions everybody else is the other they're the two dominant groups so why don't we just do that right there's ways in which everything else is subordinated in these other uh categories this racial logic is incorporated into Political Science journals academic writing and so race and ethnicity then is used interchangeably as if did the same thing and indigeneity is largely absent from both it is you often subsumed under race but remember indigeneity predates these categories and it is in terms of the idea the boundary between the civilized and the uncivilized um the migration the settlement of Canada is using migration as a strategy of settlement so as a strategy of settlement then it is using certain type of raced bodies as a way for which we settle Canada so what Canada is and so everybody else is then framed as other and then these racialized discourses are framed as sources of threat so Canada it just erases we have we had a literal head tax on Chinese immigrants we would charge them money um in order to migrate they still would migrate and then we would um force them into very specific professions or jobs and then deny their full rights and citizenship and so the the all of this is framed in terms of of how we think about those things and this hasn't changed I would like to say it's changed a little bit but there was a big um article in The Gazette I want to say a couple years ago about how a researcher on campus was taking money from Huawei as if Huawei was the source of all sorts of problems because it didn't geopolitically fit how we think about Canada and the US's position in relationship to the rest of the world and so taking this money from a Chinese company was seen as a problem on the our campus our campus is the site of these problems um and that we perpetuate these right we perpetuate them especially if we're producing those liberal ethos of something like humanitarianism about the problems out there in the world and how we should solve them this has been in the past through Community Service Learning I'll start alternative spring break things like that about where the problem is that needs to be fixed as out there rather than here and so it frames that otherness right there um we also have this idea that race is is interchangeable with ethnicity and then slowly replaced by it we still produce this over and over again we don't have racism in the Canadian Journal of political science which of Western's political science program just finished editing this journal uh last year in the last couple years um and so it's not even in there until 74. and so this isn't new this is old and this is persistent um this was from Fortune Magazine but this is the idea that even in 1938 with everything that's going on with the Nazis um the attitudes in the U.S was still we should try to keep them out um as they are we should try to keep those uh fleeing political Refugee from German and Austria and this is doubled when you look at the anti-Semitism I couldn't find it I actually have it somewhere I just couldn't find it in my notes of the ways in which the attitudes towards specifically Jews fleeing what was going on in Europe um was not seen as something that we would want to take and so the framing is everything the ways in which we frame these issues as if we think that these issues are over this is a classic kind of liberal framing um one that yes these are very contemporary issues but two oh the problem was in the past it was red it got bad in segregation and it was good now um but we can just change that if we do it like this it's red and then a little less red and then a little yellow in mass incarceration I couldn't find anything for Canada I couldn't find any of those for Canada I looked them up over and over again and we don't have any simple timelines for Canada's settlement as a strategy I was going to do it and then I thought I'm just going to step in a can of worms I do think it should be done I just didn't have time to do it today um but this is what I could find this is statscan um uh most of the stats that statscan was giving me were moving in the opposite direction this one is going upwards so the idea of progress the liberal notion of progress isn't necessarily supported by the evidence I'll get into it in the next um week's lecture but for example in the last 10 years the undp report came out today that the world is moving backwards in terms of women's rights so this idea of a natural progress or moving beyond these things isn't really supported by the data it's only supported by belief right this I just pulled this from uh the link is there from the Globe and Mail um just dealing I I don't even have time to get into some of this stuff relating to prisons and the prison industrial complex in the US and Canada but just the idea of the over-representation of indigenous and black populations in Canadian prisons speaks to versus the percentage of the population speaks to these ways in which we are still perpetuating these problems and so the the third move the kind of standard move and the move that is the most easy for those in positions of authority and hierarchies to Simply say I'm not going to talk about this or I don't want to talk about this or it's something that's not relevant to what I'm doing uh it's it's ignorance as active denial as the inability to find these issues in the everyday um and so we have all of these questions about we try to reduce them to sociological ones like like I've talked about in the past um the idea that that this is something we can study but not something we perpetuate um we have all of the ways in which it was 97 it wasn't even 91 it was 97. um all of these ways in which they re-emerged and so racial thinking doesn't go away it just takes different forms and we have different debates and the ways in which these these have come up again like I didn't think we'd be doing the Nazi stuff again but here we are we're fighting about fascism and Nazis again um and so this idea of of you know fighting Nazis in in Europe well racism is perpetuated in these states is these weird I mean I've got so many tick tocks on this and the appendix um about the ways in which this is perpetuated the idea of the UN as the Bastion of the liberal absence subject progressing towards human freedom maybe stands we have these statements over and over again but we still have the existence of apartheid we have the existence of all forms of these these laws being passed of gerrymandering of all sorts of ways in which this isn't necessarily we're moving away from and so this idea of combating racism then has a very short history so it's if we're going to do the little graph it would be a very short period that the charter has a key part of the human rights is a key part of it the Bill of Rights in 1960 but that the charter is so relatively recent that when we're thinking about the coloniality and racial classifications there's still very much part of the everyday the idea of race and racelessness race denial not thinking about subject location because you happen to be in hierarchical positions of authority western western um producing this over and over again and that political science has a key role to to play in both perpetuating and challenging this thinking I'm hoping we're doing a bit of challenging I'm not very convinced about that um because so much of what we're doing is still based in these hierarchical structures um the white supremacy has kind of bound up in how we think about these and that we are just like the very beginnings of of rethinking some of these Concepts and we're already getting all sorts of blow back right and so this idea we we have to welcome this racial Reckoning that we have to do this work there's no reason we can't be doing this work it's just some people choose not to do it and so we're thinking about those things we have to think about the ways in which we are participating in forms of of normativity right racial normativity or we're challenging racial normativity it's one or the other the oppressors in all of us you have to decide what you're going to do um with that
