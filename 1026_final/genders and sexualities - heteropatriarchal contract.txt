 so this is uh slides in a part of the chapter that I'm very in aligned with because of my biases um just the idea of thinking about where politics occurs and what is political I I always like that reset I think it's an important reset to do so the sexual contract dividing the society into public and private spheres again framed as an oppositional gender binary it's probably more complex than that women relegated to the private sphere private sphere is seen as natural corporeal emotional and the public sphere is where politics occurs man-made intellectual rational we've talked about this before so some of that comes into it here there are other ways in which this is framed the state then especially in the Monarch the Monarch is framed as a singular individual this also came up in our discussion of fascism in the body this idea of a singular body that the nation-state is as you know relations are envisioned as conflict or cooperation as as framed in terms of um you know hyper masculine male rational reason strategy games I think there's an Always Sunny episode about diplomacy when they're trying to escape from a escape room um and then the idea of the social ethics of care or things like the icrc the Red Cross is framed as as less than diplomatic or in the other space or like caring about bodies is distinct from from you know real political issues we also have violations as as ideas of penetration or violations as as violence so if you you know how dare you fly your plane into my territory is seen as violence stuff like that and then individuals are largely and this is the problem with the current International System we're stuck at 192 and then we got you know 4 000 languages or 4 000 groups um we we have individuals as non-reproductive so they we don't have a good way to do Pregnancy two-state Solutions stuff like that um all we do is create new ones and we don't really like the new States always come at the loss of an old we have a singular monovocal vision of how we think about this um and that so we've got ways in which gendered colonial normativity is embedded in the very core of of what is political and the Erasure of history and past and the reproduction of of things in which this has happened and so I just like these memes because they represent this Erasure of the kind of archetypes of masculinity and heroism and militarism um you know an excuse historical accuracies but I draw the line at Achilles being um straight in in Troy in 2004 played by um uh Brad Pitt right um and that this post was flagged because there might be adult content because they're showing the friendship as history characterized it between Achilles and uh Patrick I'm butchering that um what do you mean this is adult content it's completely platonic male bonding this is sappho and her friend um you know Alexander the Great refuses to eat cries in bed for weeks holds one of the most expensive funerals in the ancient world to his honor and then dies within eight months of losing him historians are they friends this constant Erasure right this Erasure because the public is supposed to be public and the private is supposed to be private um and so the private sphere is supposed to be apolitical but it never has been that's the whole premise of the the feminist preposition the personal is political the Spheres are not separate they constantly overlap and it's largely a fiction that we maintain in order to have domain expertise right and we established domain expertise who takes out the garbage right if we establish that whose problem is the garbage garbage is a municipal issue well global climate change would say that garbage is a global issue now right that we have to think about these things and so private relationships are inherently political um you know you can think of it this way like which relationships should get tax benefits and which one should those type of things so which ones establish the foundation of making claims and which ones don't um who who gets this and so these relationships are integral part to political life um identity is an intermediation of the institutional and personal it's this ability of of me to demand excuse me meet to demand entitlements and the state to respond to that Demand right whose demand it responds to um and the ways in which we erase Concepts and identities in its ourselves so this meme talking about this girl is we shouldn't allow them to get married because then all the girls would want to marry a girl in population would die out because we all want to marry girls right right and the ways in which we don't even know the ways in which we're involved in our own oppression and so um political work is often carried out through private channels um politics occurs in a formal and informal private ways I've done dealt with this for a long time I've never figured out a good way to write a course outline because a course outline wants an explicit legal document is really what it's doing right it's not for you or me it is when we get in disputes it's a contract dispute settlement right that's what the course outline is um and so the course outline then is there so that others when they have to come in and mediate the dispute between you and me about how you got your grade they have the document to refer to but that curriculum is just a public curriculum and so when we get to ableism um next class we'll talk about this about the ways in which the formal establishment of Law's rules and orders are always backed up by an informal curriculum which is the idiosyncratic scripted interpersonal Communications the ways that we learn when we talk to one another which is why online learning doesn't work it's okay for lectures it's not great for the interpersonal the ways in which we we learn and understand particularly in the condensed period when you are you know in your 20s and 30s it's particularly useful can be less useful labor it I don't know there's all sorts of gender normativity there's also a hidden curriculum which is unintentional and interpersonal it's structural things it's the Western bubble it's the ways in which Norms are produced it's the must-knows at uwo Facebook group it's the ways in which like things are produced and reproduced and that must knows place now all the institutional actors look at it so it becomes this other thing so everybody DMS right to get around that and so there's also things that are not included and so this textbook the reason we're using this textbook is because it's finally including a whole bunch of these things that we've never had included before and then there's also ways in which everybody kind of circulates knowledge and ideas so don't use reading notes from previous years because this is a new course and they won't help you and so those ideas of the Shadow archive that the pedagogy that's outside of how we think or or the ways in which we try to teach something but we inadvertently teach the others is the way that the political goals are always carried out in different ways indigenous black and racialized women have sought alternative means of doing politics they always have they've always done politics they've just done it differently it's why our leadership literature is so bad because it looks at existing leaders and or and then tries to figure out what's the problem with leadership and it can't because it's not actually looking at leadership it's looking at a very specific narrow conception of Who's involved in gender normativity and Leadership and what those models are so we have to look elsewhere we have to look at the black women's Collective and I don't know more as examples of this so this is from uh the the our textbook just the idea that these spaces that spheres of influence created and sustained by African-American women are not solely meant as a respite but it's where they establish political sanctuaries they're nurtured they established leadership they come to the the benefit the creative power of the community conceptualization of Family Church all of those things come together and are framed in different ways and empowered and those uh are a source of support when when people experience and black women a particular experience race gender and class oppression and so the idea here is that we have to think about the ways in which we are producing kind of are we talking about formal politics informal politics hidden politics what we're not doing no politics which is often this ignorance and then the ways in which we learn vicariously from one another um this for example this idea that we have always had people around us is this the extent to which we don't recognize the ways in which they participate in things like being housemates for 45 years and so the government then tries to come in the formal system tries to come in to regulate all those other systems and it does about as good a job as you could expect right um these efforts to regulate individual bodies and sexual activities good luck it's largely a fiction that isn't deployed uniformly and any coherent way it's deployed by hierarchical positions of authority in situations where we want to Target minority communities for whatever reason and so we have changes in the criminal code but those changes Trudeau's famous changes only make private gay sex acceptable I think it was in this reading one of the reasons that we had um that in 1969 there's legal court case because of washrooms and Montreal where paywatch and men were having sex with men in them and they tried to say well you're using a public space and they said well no because we paid for this space it's equivalent of a hotel room it's one of the reasons we probably don't have to pay washrooms anymore because public private um and so we have you know 69 we have these but then we have things like 1981 operations so soap this rating of bath houses uh the persistent criminalization of sex work I will say that bath houses exist all over the world and things happen in them all over the world um but we don't ever talk about it or we we talk about it informally um but there's all sorts of stuff that happens in all sorts of places um and that what that means is up to the people engaged in it I don't know what that means so what we're talking about here is that the ways in which these this sexual citizenship then embody citizenship with the deployment of Rights and responsibilities that come with being part of dominant or non-dominant forms of sexuality um the the emergence of two-spirit and lgbtq social movements is the the organization of their political power their channeling of resources in order to try to make dominant groups recognize the ways in which their normalization is causing harm right uh challenging these hetero patriarchal Norms the denial of rights and protections and the demand for certain rights the just the constant Erasure in the normalization this idea of this euphemism of greeting a fan after a victory like that that's a fan and so private spaces are inherently political these are the battles on the streets um the private spaces are constantly telling us things that we just choose to ignore um the problem of course is that framing everything through through certain types of hetero patriarchal regulation expanding the rights to to marriage to others is seen as successful goal but this is just largely in institutions that has been used to excuse exclude regulate and punish marginalized contact it doesn't change the underlying contract in any way um and that ways in which like these experiences are just constantly erased both in terms of who's telling the story how they're telling the story and what those stories are being told is part of the problem of the heteropatriarchal contract
