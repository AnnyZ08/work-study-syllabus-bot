 um so I I just want to Define these terms because I included these terms and they weren't included in the original reading because as I said I don't know why we would start with a kind of derogatory concept to talk about how we shouldn't be derogatory um and so this is the human rights office they talk a lot again the the framing of this textbook has been about framing from the global to the the local and trying to bypass the state or use the global to criticize the local I think because it's doing this rhetorical argument about um we shouldn't leave things up to individual states we should all collectively agree on on what is going on so there's a human rights office talking about ableism what is ableism discrimination based on a value system that considers certain body and mind characteristics essential to living a fulfilling life and assumes that the quality of life of people with disabilities must be very low in ableism like in racism homophobia and other forms of Oppression dominant social groups project their own image as the model for how Humanity should be rejecting or ignoring others as inferior not normal or unfit this bias is used to justify their exclusion sometimes even their extermination one example is the Eugenics movement which emerged in the early 20th century and resulted in the force sterilization of more than 60 000 women men and children with disabilities under the pretext of improving Humanity's gene pool in Nazi Germany more than 300 000 persons with disabilities were exterminated because their lives were considered unworthy but despite the scale of these atrocities ableism continues to spread and its significance remains little understood ableist social views still shape our understanding of what it means to live with disabilities and how the lives of people with disabilities are valued thousands of women and girls continue to be sterilized against their will and many more persons with disabilities spend their lives confined in institutions prisons or at home and deemed to be incapable of living in the community ableism underpins the way our societies are organized basic daily activities such as going to school or work taking public transport doing groceries or practicing a hobby are made difficult if not impossible for persons with disabilities and end up excluded and isolated human rights Challenge ableism and other forms of Oppression and fight for a world where diversity is valued and embraced humanity is always changing people everywhere use their minds and bodies in different ways and those differences are what makes us stronger human diversity is all around us we are all part of it let's embrace it [Music] I mean okay but do you see how and so I think this textbook does what what this this does too we have no specifics here um we have specifics of harm but we don't have people here we have literal blobs um because this Fabian socialism of the UN Human Rights office as the textbook clearly points out wants to individuate the problem and say the problem is both individual and systemic but provides no Solutions no ways in which it gets worse no ways in which it gets better we just point to extremes like Nazi Germany as a foundation for don't do this but it doesn't provide an argument for why this is happening the ways it's perpetuated and let's be clear the UN is just as as responsible for this type of stuff as anybody else um so this idea then in the general comment number eight in the rights of persons with disabilities describes ableism as a value system that considers certain typical characteristics that bind a body of mind is essential for living a life of value based on strict standards functioning Behavior or appearance ableist ways of thinking contribute to disability as a misfortune that leads to human suffering this adversely affects opportunities for work employment and just living life right um so one of the ways I thought this was an interesting way to do it is to talk about the ways with a more concrete form like with actual humans you know um again human actual people let's do people um because this allows us to to at least see some people and the ways in which we're comfortable and uncomfortable with this and so we I showed this in my class last term and we had some problems with this too about the ways that it it reinforces ability and disability but it's at least a specific campaign so this is ageism as a form of ableism it's a substance so what's this all about okay [Laughter] I'm too old for this you just want me to say what people say about me weird question I guess my teacher says yoga out of it it's just a phase it was never a face I never grew out of it I guess I'm too Reckless I don't know people like to talk very loudly to me they say I don't think things through you're looking still good for your age I'll figure it out when I'm older you are having a senior moment [Music] it feels like I'm not given a chance I need to keep up oh get out of the way I lack experience or too much experience I'm baggage only weighing people down looking at my age like it is a disease where I work no one takes me serious it makes me powerless when people see only my age [Music] so I think everyone short of Immortals has age and so we do normalize our experience of our age both in how we relate to others who we see as as the same age and those that we see as different from the age that we expect them to be which is the ways in just this normalcy just reproduces itself on steroids all the time because everybody's subject position then makes them a little bit prejudiced towards everybody else's subject position so it's it's it's it's not going to be resolved right something like this will not be resolved because people are going to pattern recognition you know we learn through repetition and if we repeat ourselves with the same experience over and over again then we get a new experiences it's shocking to us but we do have to at least think the politics of this right thinking the politics of this is the beginning of thinking about what rights do we need to set how do we need to frame these things and how do we need to distinguish between actions that are causing harm and actions that we need to be responsible for um so it there's no resolution here um I think it's very clear about that in the reading but that this is the beginning of thinking of a politics this is how politics emerges
 so this inevitably becomes a question and this is to follow from last time I don't have an answer um in terms of green we probably want everything to be as green as possible um and as quick as possible in terms of of addressing energy concerns and climate change concerns um but then we produce all of these other issues but do we have access do we have ways in which we accommodate do we have you know basic things that you can do it as simple as like places for people to breastfeed um do we produce those do we have things that people can have Braille access that doesn't say like there's a whole bunch of those subreddits about like something in Braille just says put this in Braille or um the ways in which you have closed captioning I mean I I don't know my daughter wants everything with closed captioning she's 15. um and so this idea of of access for different types of abilities is always going to be there as I talked about in the lecture this idea of restrooms being out of order or not having access or not building public restrooms or ways in which people do it so people who are going to need to use restrooms have to do it in a private way the ways in which um all of these impact the ability to to travel as I talked about in the last uh video so this idea then of of functioning normally is just coded in this language right about how things should happen and who they should happen for um the inadequacy of public infrastructure is a constant issue I have some data on that as well um the public-private partnership is perceived of as the way to innovate now we can use these simple and ridiculous example of sports stadiums the idea that the public should put in money for sports stadiums because there is I don't know Prestige and benefit that everyone gets to experience when you go to a stadium therefore we should give public money to private actors who get to reap it is still a thing we do um and so disability is not framed as a larger social problem and the lack of public infrastructure is not referenced I went um to the this is policy options website just to see um some data I was trying to find metadata on infrastructure I've got a bit about the US very little about Canada we have under the last government taken up this idea of infrastructure the U.S is in the opposite position where their infrastructure is crumbling it was designed to be like 50 years old just falling apart there's a whole book there's a now every military when you commission something you have to do Rust analysis because for years and years and years people designed everything and didn't do any analysis about the rusting and when you're spending 800 billion dollars a year and you're not thinking about how infrastructure falls apart it's as important to think about how Things Fall Apart as they work when they work best right we like to idealize right we like to think of the perfect scenario and go from there so on the Paul when I looked up infrastructure on policy options it was all related to ageism and elderly and our aging population I was going to show that graph right it used to be that like we had a big young population and a small old population now it's kind of like a silo all the way up and so this idea then that more and more people are going to require that infrastructure this is just I just pulled this it circulated a lot it's Doug Henwood did this you know whatever he's left he posted it in um it's a bunch of Lefty places it doesn't matter the date is the data right uh this is just net civilian fixed interest investment in the public sector as a percentage of GDP I could not find this data for Canada I looked for it I was on statscan I was looking over I couldn't find it um all I got is the the investment in total amount which doesn't tell us anything in terms of GDP um I could do it but it's just I don't think it's worth it this is the argument we are especially in the west investing Less in infrastructure over time in part because the cost in part because of what was in that video and as this average per the decades this idea of moving towards market-based provision so we don't need a NASA to produce a public good of a space shuttle we can pay the private sector to do it and they get the benefit of profit as well and so this is as close as I could find this is a little bit dated but there is an interesting argument that's happening here is that as we have shifted politically away from the idea that we um the government should be basically doing what a mortgage does right the government should take out debt in order to to um um allow you to build a bigger house or build infrastructure build other Assets in 1955 the idea of the federal government taking a role in these issues was uh key it was kind of split between the the federal the provinces and the municipal level by 2013 we see that the federal government is now down to 15 the provinces and the municipal is taking over half so you'll see a lot of the Innovations in terms of parks and development and accessibility and infrastructure is happening in the municipal space in part because Municipal governments don't have parties right Municipal governments are too small and too local for that they also have direct access to a tax base and you don't really have a mechanism to vote a party out at the federal level you can scream and scream and scream every time one of these governments gets elected on a tax issue and so when we do that all of them are more hesitant to use federal level taxes to do these things it erodes federalism in general forces everything to the provinces and the municipalities and means that infrastructure is going to be more and more idiosyncratic right you're not going to have the canada-wide infrastructure that would establish baselines in key sectors or ways of doing things you have everything shifting to the provincial and Municipal level and even the provincial over that period has gone down not as much but it has gone down and so as a spending of GDP this is the I could find it was 2013. this idea is that it's been somewhat steady but it's dropped from six percent to three percent and so this idea about who should do this and how we should do this is also about who who should build infrastructure and who they should build it for and I it depends on your community I guess which is a messed up way to think about rights that increasingly Canada has moved to a framework that says it's up to your community to decide whether or not you're going to do these assessments you're going to build the infrastructure that is is doing these things now you can pass laws provincially which we've done you can pass laws federally that require things but the cost is still going to be done at those levels and the decision making is going to be largely related to those costs and so instead of thinking about expanding the public goods because they benefit everyone publicly we're increasingly thinking about well we don't want to spend that money and we're only going to build infrastructure locally right we're not going to establish ways in which it's easy for us to like China get from one high speed part of the country to another so they don't rely on cars we don't do any of that and that the ableism environment doesn't it's not just about um being different and causing danger it's that we don't feel safe because of it right it's because you don't have you know that when you go out there's a risk that that thing's not going to work or there's not going to be something there it increases your risks and so the decisions we make in infrastructure and design result in differential risk and that differential risk is just people calculator right um and so it's this framing of the absent subject as if you aren't going to need care and you aren't going to need concern and you aren't going to need to think about these things and so this framing of disability as the status quo is really this remedy poison scapegoat this view of of the disabled as the source of their problems it bleeds into how we think about things it bleeds into framings that are normal I have I can't even show it anymore I used to show it in my social movements class it's a letter that was sent by a woman in Kingston Ontario I'm going to say in 2015 2016 not a long time ago just a horrific letter basically arguing for eugenics um because they have somebody they're they're I don't know their kid and their Senator I don't know um it was um autistic um and it's just a horrible thing I won't even platform it anymore but this is all of it is framed into terms of normal normal normal it's all through the letter it's the idea of normal remember normal didn't exist as a concept um until like basically the 1800s and so prior to that time like people had all sorts of weird stuff nobody looked what was inside your pants and nobody cared about how you were differently abled it was the idea that like you know we should try to assist and we should try to help because you know people people and so this idea of how we think about these things um you know what we're doing then is when we're serving the government is increasing the idea of what are the categories and then saying well these are issues of concerns we're adopting the the UN model right look at these problems that exist why don't you guys deal with it rather than saying that it's a federal or provincial responsibility to deal with these things and so it gets pushed to the municipal level we're identifying ever more forms of disability um as if the identification is the same as doing something and then as a scapegoat it is is used for a term of problems we wouldn't want to address we we frame everything and oh that's too expensive or that's to this as if we don't get the benefit from those things and that we aren't moving towards all of us I mean in some way in case someone's figured out a way around linear time we're all moving towards needing more of these resources over time um and that there yeah I won't even say those words but this idea I mean there's a reappropriation of of of there has been a reappropriation of that um but I I you know I'm not interested in those but this way is in which not that I'm not interested I'm not interested in doing that work um and so uh this idea then is that there are some reappropriation but the language you use matters right because it frames how we think about these issues um this idea is that politics then about these contested claims is always going to be making decisions on where resources go right resources in terms of just I'm going to fix my language or not right um disability is still largely outside of how we think about politics because we're thinking from the center what affects the most people the most rather than thinking about what affects everyone and how can we everyone benefit so we don't frame it in those terms I'm not making Socialist Communist arguments there I'm talking about benefit in terms of well-being right um and then this idea of um how does disability Force like addiction Force us to either you can be sympathetic or critical right fall into the idea that well it's their problem and therefore I shouldn't have to deal with it and this you know this exclusion um if we thought about it as kind of the status quo of experience rather than as individuated problems we'd probably be able to address these things more adequately we need to kind of re think how we frame different ability that's why I focused on ableism we need to challenge the categorizations about conditions about status and stop using human as the referent use capabilities recognize that our physical and social environment reproduces status quo and it reproduces attitudes about government in the way that we do government and then rethink how we think about ability and and enabling more ability in everyday life not modern I don't think we need that um and so yeah that's the end of uh those discussions again I think we need a glossary here um I just haven't developed it as much as I've developed the other one so I've got a thousand Tick Tock saved um and so uh not all of them are about that but they will be over time
 okay um so this is our chapter on um on ableism and disability I added the ableism stuff because there's a bunch of things in this chapter um that we can talk about as we go through um it has a specific theoretical underpinning that it's not um talking about I'm also curious about the absence subject here um uh so my mother is legally blind um but the reason I had filmed like this is because I have an issue um I just wondered there's doesn't seem to be a lot of like voice so I think there's a glossary needed for this week too I just don't think I have enough assembled yet which also speaks to the ways in which kind of the amplification of voices happen we're talking about voices today as well okay so the learning objectives so we'll we'll frame ability disability as individual and and non-political demonstrate the way in which disability is expressed as a form of public policy has negative consequence negative consequences um I would frame this as just for all of us like rights right if one group is being actively suppressed marginalized or unable to articulate themselves that's probably as much on us as it is on them and so this chapter introduces this idea of the the pharmacon um it's an interesting concept it largely comes from uh dareda derida's reading of this term and a specific reading that he does so Jack derida famous philosopher of deconstruction I mean lots of insights on the ways in which Things Fall Apart and so he kind of rereads the concept of Farrakhan against the idea of remedy of poison as also as a scapegoat as as this way in which we can get around having to deal with things or put it on somebody else so we don't have to deal with it um and so we'll explain how Transportation policy does this I also kind of want to talk a bit about infrastructure this is the shortest chapter so it gives me a little more space to add some stuff and then we're going to discuss ways in which ableism might be uh reconceptualized and re-engaged in politics and public policy and explore how political science can unveil the illusion of inclusion that's a lot of alliteration um by critically engaging in the term I I that's why I would like ableism I don't the the discs I've got it in here I think it stems from a specific tradition that we probably want to be conscious of um the ways in which we produce certain ways of understanding and being um so yeah there's there's a lot of stuff bound up in here um I'm gonna talk a bit about normalcy as I have all the way throughout um I I don't you know this comes from my own literature so I've written on Norms um specifically on Norm confusion um and the idea that a norm doesn't really make sense it is sense making but it doesn't make sense it's it's specific it's contingent it's historical it's it's what happens at a specific point in time so um the idea of disability then is really about the production of a concept of what it means to be normal and then using that concept to police others as we've talked about through um you know there's an assumption of this something like that the individual is not set up to deal with as well and again the individual here is is an absence subject the individual is always one that is doesn't have specific characteristics and so everybody is like I'm hard-pressed to think one of you or me or anyone will not have problems walking later in life in which case there are going to be things that cause impediments to that and the question is are we doing it for for individuals we perceive as needing it or does it benefit everybody to have that right so and so this separation from the normal um yeah this idea of distribution we've talked about this before in the context of gender it's very similar um you know the politics and governance of of ability and and disability preserves the status quo um securing some at the expense of others yeah sure okay that's fine um I will say this is my addition to this the concept of normalcy largely comes out of the modern the high modern ideology of the experience of Western Enlightenment um ideas about the state can do more than just tax and raise militaries it can regulate and so part of what that comes out of is is science and medicine wants to discover um how bodies function as we talked about last time they become obsessed with what's in our pants they also become obsessed with like is there Universal characteristics so one of the ways in which we get to this idea of normalcy is all of these different iterations that science went through to try to figure out if there was something that we could could figure out if people were the same and different so the way we figure out um and so there's a bunch of ways it does this it like I said it's the bell curve the normal distribution and so it's trying to cover the bulk of the people the bulk of the time which produces the idea of normalcy um you know even Marxism has is the rest on the aggregation of working bodies the premise of the labor theory of value that everything produced in the world comes from labor and and its capitalism that ex alienates us from our own labor and allows some to exploit us and get rich while the rest of us work ourselves um endlessly and so the norm then all it does is is the concept of normativity um comes out of this idea of this normal distribution that somehow that there's a normal distribution and I've got examples here that we'll talk about in a minute of efforts to find what is normal and then creation of deviance outliers aberrations and so the discs of disability is really about this idea of framing as lack thereof and so it individuates the opposite to the this dominant and this far away from as in discarded and so it's got all of these ways in which it reproduces normalcy in the concept um this is a famous article that deals with um the this effort to develop what what binds everybody together primarily as a mechanism of policing and control so the state had this problem in that prior to the discovery of something that could let us track people um it was pretty easy to commit a crime uh in one area and just move to another um you just change your name the state doesn't really have any way to regulate you this is prior to to well I mean how would you do it right we barely have photography so what the state started doing is trying to develop different things trying to categorize people through this normal distribution of let's take pictures or or images of those that are um in the society who aren't criminals and those in the society that are are criminals and say what lumps them together and so this is what is normal people who don't commit crimes and do things and this is what is deviant everything else so um and we were trying to do this in order to track right to track criminals and track them down and we do this today with DNA testing and never give your DNA to a private DNA company because in the case of Dallas they use the stuff from 23andMe to do broad sweeps of genetic material anyways back in the day they took pictures of ears they thought ears were unique and that they could figure if they could figure out a way to take a picture of everybody's ears they'd have a database of ears because they even have images and they have database you can watch old episodes of Law and Order like prior to the internet um you would have to look through literal photographs of of um criminals because you wouldn't have any way to identify the mix-up through sight and so they tried this eventually they got to fingerprints which are assumed to be unique but in practice haven't been one of the um suspects of a Spanish Subway bombing was picked up in the middle of I think was like Idaho or something had never left the U.S just happened to have this fingerprints it's as much art as science in terms of doing this and so where we get normal from is these early statisticians trying to figure out how we categorize society and um you know emerging from those people that were assumed remember there isn't this idea of social Mobility per se a lot of these legacies that we've talked about of back to Aristotle of different categories of people are different categories of people they're not the same things we don't have a kind of conception of humans per se we have classes right and so back to last week and the week before this idea of race and and reason is what establishes some groups from others the poor laws that I talked about before and so as a at the concept of a social whole or a society then produces well if this is a fixed number let's see what the distribution is in that number and we'll get to this next week if we don't have borders it's much harder for us to make those claims and so we have to be able to define a community and then see the distribution in that community and the Assumption here is and it's a Eugenics assumption is that there is always the same distribution this gaussian distribution of people's capabilities and characteristics and so Alexander Graham Bell feared that people who were deaf would breed with breed look at everything would um would have children with other people with the same characteristics and create this this this race using that word race of deaf people um and so now Cochlear implants has been a big controversy because it has a language and community and culture that technology wants to remove and so it's it's been a big thing I'm I'm not wading into that mess it's a it's a very interesting discussion I'm just not going to get into in here um and Emma Goldman the anarchist famously said that birth control was needed to prevent poppers syphilitic epileptics alcoholics that word criminals and degenerates so this idea of the lower classes of the lower races was just a broad sweeping characterization um built into the premise of of how we think about things those kind of markers of of Canadian iconography at Brantford um has him all over the place as as this was supposed to be and so the reason that we did it this way was it is easy to lump all the problems of society into these groups right and to blame all the problems of society into these groups there's a reason that this eugenesis stuff goes on steroids with the Nazis right all of these ideas um were perceived of that we still don't like let's be clear we still don't have adequate mechanisms to deal with addiction as a society we are not designed to deal with addiction it is not at all clear and we've got like 150 years of it that um are mechanisms of addiction treatment are more effective in one form or another everything from cold turkey through full rehab their effectiveness levels vary um and there is an argument a political argument that it's not about about curing addiction it's about treating addiction so people can leave normal lives right say we don't get rid of those addictions like we've got a whole society set up around alcohol addiction as if it's normal right um it's just produced we know that it has negative consequences but we've decided to decide we're going to organize things we're going to regulate it but we're not going to you know prohibit it per se some people still believe that some people want to do that there's but I mean we just went through the prohibitionist regime around cannabis right and there will there will be moral panics over and over again about this idea so a lot of state fairs then we still have Ontario fall fairs um have these competitions that do this to this day think about like when you go to a if you do it's the whitest thing ever if you go to a fair listen London Ontario's had problems with with race and racism at their farmers markets Farmers Market says sites of whiteness or a big problem um but if you go to a Fall Fair they have competitions for like the prettiest whatever right the aesthetically pleasing whatever which means that like for example carrots um for the longest time like 40 to what is it 30 to 40 of all carrots were thrown in the garbage because they didn't look pretty um it took somebody in California to realize you could make baby carrots uh in order to utilize something we were throwing out because it didn't look pretty fall fairs like they grade the prettiest or the best looking of each type of thing everything from cookies to pies to vegetables whatever and it's still based in this idea that if there's a normal distribution let's find the best right let's find the top of that curve so who's the fittest families what are the intelligence tests uh the Gerber baby was effectively a eugenicist idea of creating the perfect at in terms of aesthetic baby um then journal Nature approved the Nazi use of eugenics for sterilizing um Madame Bovary was you know the height of the populist novel in modernity it was thoroughly anti-semitic and eugenic and so the our spaces reproduce normalcy all the time which then says this is what belongs and this is what doesn't and the university classroom does this like everywhere else um there are all sorts of ways I minimized it here you can click the link but the language I'm going to commit these problems we're still going to put these problems the Washington racial slurs the football team in Washington up till 2020 was using an explicit racist slur as its mascot and everybody said well because they do it you know why can't I what's the big deal well because you shouldn't be doing it right um and so we do this all the time although these languages there's no way for me to to say that without producing the problem but we have all sorts of ableist language all over how we talk all the time um and so we have Expressions euphemisms sayings that are just bound up in this that are caught up in the way that we think and they produce like all these micro harms like it hurts people when you say those things doesn't hurt the group saying it um and it might not be the primary concern of those other people because they deal with it so often but it's still an issue these were the you know the these are the states in the U.S in 1935 that were still doing um uh eugenic sterilization um all over the place in terms of the numbers um uh so this is not this is less than 100 years ago we're still doing and as I've mentioned before with indigenous communities we're still doing it we're just doing it I guess not systemically though it's happening systemically it's not being ordered but it's still being done anyways um so one of the issues that comes out then is the language we use and how we think about what the production is this is actually from a student at Western in 2014 who encountered Prejudice from her Prof in a classroom um about this idea of of having an identity that that that Prof didn't want to deal with the interesting part about this response was that um there is a strategy an explicit strategy of just silence of dealing with silence so this is always the danger of me doing uh video lectures is that we don't actually have any feedback mechanisms and that we're both silent um I think we've understood that the being in person helps but being in person also produces a bunch of uh Notions about normalcy ability in agency that the premise of Universal Design and this really reinforced it for me the part of the reason that we in this course do things the way we do is because we are moving towards Universal Design the textbook has audio outputs it has ways to do this now there's all sorts of problems with that but we'll get into it um and so when we think about questions of who speaks and how they speak and who can speak we like to think about them as being reasonable well it's unreasonable that I change my language because everybody uses that word it's unreasonable that I do this or that and normally what reason means is that it's an in-group saying that an out group doesn't have the right to tell them what The Thinker do or say right but that reason itself is normally bounded it's bounded by the dominance the attitudes the opinions the efficiency whatever it is whatever word you use to do this and then this idea that stems from that is that if that's the question is silence the same as agreement um who can question reason and how can it happen we've had throughout this course three different Traditions um one is this idea and I I think it is in the western Canon it's specifically back to Aristotle um against the sophists right against the populists that reasonable language is how we develop the best policy reason to debate with evidence and argument is the best way to produce the best political outcomes the problem is and we've said since day one is that um contestation is inherent to politics and groups the rhetorics the sophists could simply say whatever can be argued and whatever convinces people is what's right right it's morally relativist but it's also politically Salient it's very Machiavellian and and it's kind of how advertising in PR functions right as long as we're not committing explicit falsehoods we are convincing you that this is good and that is bad you need to throw out that and buy this right whatever it is um and then so the critical tradition then is really about how reason reflects power and so the ability of a Prof to tell a student that they're wrong and that student responding with silence reflects a system of power where that happens here's an example I just pulled this example we can pull these examples this is what I'm doing the philosophers you can find examples just lying about everywhere I got this one in my email inbox it's from um the hill times so this is Parliament Hill in Canada um and the question raised here is about the the even the the need or accountability of language so this is an interesting one in that the Department of National Resources was asked a series of point to questions by the conservative opposition um about what um as an MP that MP in a reasonable Democratic Society and a government agency has an obligation to provide information to that MP um the weird part about this though is that these mining projects are something that's contentious between Canada U.S and it's an opposition member um and that the idea then of of these questions being asked by an mtmp um for the government with an explicit memo was do not answer the question directly but provide a response to the spirit of the questions which is to say language means nothing it's you can basically respond to any question or say anything you can speak past each other because there's no obligation to some notion of the truth so this is the current this is the federal liberal government telling a conservative opposition member um that we are going to answer your questions how we think your questions are asking us something but we're not going to reasonably say this and this is in the memo they've got here it's way too small to see but its idea is basically uh provide a response to the spirit of the question um and and direct it as appropriate so this idea of of public relations or of advertising of marketing is about using language as a way to convince people that they shouldn't think they should just react um you know redirect the question bridge to what you want to talk about deal with broad arguments discuss them the way that you want to deal with them deal with the spirit of the question I don't know what a spirit of a question is it seems very weird to talk about the fact that you as an obligation have an obligation to answer a question but you can reason your way into I don't know I don't I don't know can we have commensurate ideas do our ideas anything but a reflection of power and this here is is a standing MP asking a government agency to provide answers and the government's attitude is [Music] we don't have to have to have reasonable answers or reasonable discussions and so this is a more substantive question about the language we use the ways we think and the way we organize society as to whether or not we see it as being reasonable and having something in common or we see it as entirely contingent and contested and every group is going to decide what is reasonable for them and so the question becomes what are we doing in this chapter are are we engaging in a form of trying to convince people to be more reasonable I don't like the use of disability here I like the idea of ableism but the textbook has decided to go in this root of framing it through this farcamon of disability because it it's has multiple meanings but I'm not sure we agree with that I don't know what the answer is here and and I don't have any solutions to the answer and I'm going to make mistakes and you're going to make mistakes and you're going to have to decide which language you think is appropriate
 so I'm just going to include the link rather than watch it through with you on this one there's a fundamental politics of design that underpins all of the questions of the social right one of the interesting things about China's growth has been the emergence of a consumer middle class has also meant the massive construction of infrastructure um all right there's many examples of this at one point I think China was putting up a um a multiplex like movie theater a week um you know this this example of a a construction firm erecting a 57 stories skyscraper in 19 days the speed of this design is built in to the ways in which they're building infrastructure so in 12 years that's the the rail and high-speed infrastructure that China was able to build um versus the problems that come from that you may be able to do it fast and this is one of the complaints over and over again about um development and infrastructure in Canada I don't have a good answer for this again I think it's like the the farcamon thing um having the capacity to build things like infrastructure High-Speed Rail is absolutely good for the environment it's public transit it's what everybody needs it's what people who are differently able can absolutely use rather than everybody being required to have cars which is kind of how Canada's been built and there's the video after this explains that um also think about it in terms of environments that these types of design can be green because they're consciously thought to do so so the impetus for a lot of the public infrastructure in China is to try to get it off of dirty energy or forms of energy that are more sustainable reliable or Dependable whatever so that is thinking green but it's thinking green in a kind of self-centered way we'd have to think green here too but we have to do things like environmental assessments then we have to have Community input then we have to have things like accessibility then we have to have things like um uh impact assessments and open debate rates and forums and the ways in which we discuss all of these questions the idea of us doing all those things is so that we will get something that is closer to a Universal Design when we build infrastructure but it's slow and so the question becomes what do you value when we're thinking about building things and so the video below is is going to talk about um it's more specifically about the ways in which um small groups have led to the design of Suburbia in particular which is ecologically a nightmare in terms of Social Services really hard and in terms of ability very difficult as well in my neighborhood here one of the choices that was made was no sidewalks so no sidewalks in subdivisions as a way on one side of the road at bare minimum sometimes on neither side as a way to keep the costs down in terms of tax base and for the municipality but that's short-term thinking in terms of livability and now we're in the circumstances where I mean I've talked to our counselor many times about this um they're stuck they can't make the changes because at the outset they design for cheap and fast and now they want to have livable and can't do that you've got to redesign design or you've got to move or you've got to change things and so the idea of the individualization of these issues is not an individual issue they're about the extent to which we think these issues from the outset and so that's what the politics is doing of this week is to say can you think about these things when you speak when you uh design when you make claims and when you talk about representation because are you actually representing these groups when you make some type of claim or are you just reinforcing ideas and so everybody knows like the TTC might getting my mom in and out to Toronto we have to get my sister to meet her at at the Go stations because go is okay but TTC is a nightmare for people who are visually visually impaired um and so this idea of um disability as the reason that people don't travel it's no it's because they can't reliably like I was talking to my mom the other day she just said once she knows where the the things are at the station then she can function out there but the design of every station is so distinct because they want to express the the community for people who need things to be in the same place it doesn't work it makes it harder it makes it more difficult and so framing disability is the reason that people don't travel is blaming somebody for us that have said yes screw you um and so this idea then of obstacles like washrooms and seats are just kind of Basics that if you don't think about and they're not there they won't do it um access icons but no washrooms right things things like that and so that's the politics of design video I'll just put it in the the playlist um because it's long and I don't have a whole lot to contribute it's just something interesting um to think about when we're thinking about infrastructure what kind of infrastructure are we building who are we building it for and what are the costs associated with it
 so this farcamon of of disability um produces these contradictions because Society by its nature is is framing things that are reasonable um that's what policy is right um you're able to justify why you're doing it even if it's just a majoritarian sensibility um you're you're doing something because you can reasonably argue that it is producing some output right whatever it is and so this idea of of Rights versus burden is a kind of constant framing um the idea of an cost is is friend I think there's a third option there right this idea of seeing them as lesser while also having these kind of social Dimensions about workplace accommodations or how work should function um I think it's probably framed wrong um that was the thing when when Nick and I undertook redoing 10 20 we came with the idea with the teaching support center of really adopting Universal Design right about this idea of producing um the capacity of people being able to to to have injuries be ill experience things concussions whatever that make it hard for them to learn at one point so then they have access to these resources no matter what the circumstance right the weird part about that is is that these innovators in particular with something like chat gbt ruthless Ruth's ruthlessly exploits the universality of that design as also a mechanism by which it can accumulate all sorts of information assess immediately undermine Challenge and so the universality of design is also one that makes it very easy to be appropriated right um here's an example right for a price uh neuro neurodivergent fonts I was looking at this whether or not I could could Institute these fonts we've seen these before for people with different ways of of reading they are better but it's a subscription right it's like all the fonts you have included in your stuff paid for designed now we're saying that if you want this you have to subscribe to it for a lifetime maybe we need to do that but it's weird right that your ability is it's not just that you're you're where you're providing you with a useful service right I grew up with the emergence of the internet so the emergence of the internet was you buy you bought software you ran the software yes it might have security flaws yes it might have the rest of it but you you owned that piece of software it worked forever that was a bad framework in terms of security and updates it was a great framework in just having the thing and using an old ass computer um that worked right um rather than updates which intentionally disable or argue that there's a security vulnerability and therefore we can no longer support that right we've got life cycles now on this stuff that's two to three years not very environmentally sound and so thinking about the ways in which we have produced this notion of of using things like fonts to generate new sources of revenue I'm not sure that a font needs a subscription it's a font right like maybe it's going to be updated I don't know it's a font it's so weird um anyways so thinking about um ability and disability is not just social factors a social phenomenon how we organize ourselves in terms of social effectivity so this one is used this has been memeed to death as well I'm not going to put any in here because they're really offensive but um the idea here is that liberal Notions of reason and equality result in the idea that everyone benefits from the exact same supports under the assumption of the absent subject that we're all the same doesn't make a ton of sense it only works for majority communities that actually are the same which given what we did last week and dealing with just gender half of us aren't the same at bare minimum right um it's probably I maybe a third is dictating that the sameness goes for everybody um and maybe even less than that right um okay and so when we're talking about Equity then it's also about providing supports specifically needed for each group and so this is efforts needed to overcome the differences between people and so we want to have equality but in order to actually have equality we need to have Equity because we need more supports for those people The Next Step would be Justice the source of the foundation of the lack of equality and the lack of equity is addressed by a mechanism which everybody gets the same issue everybody gets access to the same thing and so um here this is this is a good example of this I'll do this and go back because this is a good way some people believe that Society should not adjust or adapt to support them marginalized community if that Community is a relatively small part of the population this is a perfect opportunity to talk about a phenomenon called the curb cut effect curb Cuts those miniature ramps on sidewalks were first built in California in the 1960s to address the needs of wheelchair users they are now Universal sidewalk feature relied upon by people with strollers bikes scooters carts and more the curb cut effect demonstrates that when we make changes to help a marginalized Community we as an entire Society benefit closed captioning was created for those with hearing impairments and is now used by anyone in a noisy environment text to speech is useful for anyone with busy hands gender-neutral bathrooms are a godsend for anyone just seeking privacy inclusive family and parental leave policies benefit straight couples with unique caregiving situations steps we make to take care of the few positively impact the many [Music] see this whole lecture in a tick tock much easier um and so this social asocial characterization is largely just about people not liking change I guess I use the words I want to use don't make me use different words I use the steps I want to use don't make me use different words until I need those steps or words different then I want them changed and so this is the problem of kind of reducing everything to thinking about individuals is that we don't think about the social benefit of doing things for public for everybody and so um this idea of disability as an individual limitation between a person and their environment really reinforces this absent subject and yes I I would like a glossary for this week as well just to kind of go over these types of things because there's a lot out there and I just haven't combed through it but also I do think these platforms reinforce certain ways of doing it and so disability is seen as an individual problem as this kind of biology gone wrong that's not even a legible sentence to me um because it's a a moral assertion of a fact right like what does that even mean I don't like sky bad Sky what like it just doesn't make any sense anyways so this is very much thinking like a state that you then identify with your state because I guess you pay into taxes I mean you don't have to pay into taxes you can live in Florida and have sales tax but you contribute to that society and therefore Society shouldn't do things that you don't want even if you benefit from them you know what I mean we end up in these places and so these programs are reducing everything to forms of degradation or a proof of disability or testing protocols um this idea of the this medical bureaucratic management of disability these ableist assumptions Remains unquestioned by the largest Society um I had an example here I heard this anecdotally that they apparently Rick Mercer talks about this I couldn't find the video though um this is not just like like marginalized people these are people who fought for the uh that veteran services needs you to verify that your limb hasn't grown back and they changed it so it wasn't annually you only had to do it every three years well that's great these people are having to try travel hundreds of kilometers to the locus local veterans the closest Veterans Affairs office to prove that their limb hasn't grown back like that level of bureaucracy is just I don't even know we could talk about bureaucracy we go into Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucracy about who it's for and what it's doing um this kind of governmentality of of doing it it's not at all clear and so the example used in the textbook is just this idea of borrowing a book from the University Library information wants to be free steelbooks um and that uh I didn't say that um that books stacked on shelves up a stairwell or narrow Corridor requires vision and physical Mobility I've had I think I had a student last year check to see how many braille books Western has in the library I think we have one so there's that uh but I mean we are using like um my mom's got all the software now that just reads it and listen Apple's been great on this they're putting accessibility in Apple devices and everyone's using them like we see this all the time people are getting it at in the Innovative sectors it's the government sectors that that remain behind and I I will talk about that in the next video about why that is um and so all of these things require Vision physical Mobility agility um or assistance in retrieving books um on higher desks or at some type of government certification that you have this need rather than do it listen I'm not a big fan of physical books um I do think there's a debate about whether or not they're more efficient than having a PDF that requires a store of energy infinitely but we do know that like they're extremely heavy they require a lot of cooling and heating they take up physical space and in the case of robots at UT it's slowly sinking right it's because it's so heavy books are heavy um and so the problem of course is that the onus is put on the individual to seek assistance rather than develop the social environments to provide services if it's a service it should be provided right access to knowledge then Still Remains ableist design remains ableist and then we have questions about how do governments make decisions about design as it relates to ableism what kind of input and whose input so it's not just that you do the design it's that you have the social structures in place to deal with the consequences of the design so this is in Toronto this is just somebody talking about the situations in Toronto what ableism looks like in the winter this is supposed to be an accessible crosswalk and because of the the snow pile I can't even get to the button and the curb cutout is covered in snow in order to physically cross the street I have to wait in the lane of oncoming traffic until the light changes and the curb cut it on the other side is also inaccessible due to snow as well as the button City of Toronto give your head a shake and that's [Music] was that supposed to be a loop anyways um and so this is exactly how these are social questions these are individual questions and that's not an individual question that's a systemic question that what's the point of putting in the infrastructure and design if you're not going to service the design and infrastructure right if you're not going to do those things and so all of this un framing from the as a right space model to individual experience of Rights misses everything in the Middle Design infrastructure bureaucracy registration development all of it's in there
 so in the effort to deal with what is basically an unresolvable issue at least in its current form because Society itself at a certain level is the problem right the The Binding Together by that which binds together is necessarily exclusionary and you can't get around that um but we do need to analyze and understand the politics of this right and I've got examples of this as well and so the idea here is that the chapter lays out the notion of disability being a peculiar politics because it is a a a overlapping way of res of reflecting the status quo of power right and so people our bodies are going to naturally resist and be dominated and exploited and oppressed by that power but we have to understand how it functions right so this idea of the um farcamon as as the I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right again because it's you got to interact with people right like this type of stuff um so a remedy of poison an escape code and so this is an example and I'll use a video in a second to talk about this um opioids right um it is a remedy that was suggested for severe pain um that also can with overdose be a poison causing addiction or death and then um there is also the reason to dismiss the user as an addict and therefore unsavable not deserving and um someone that is a social ill or harm rather than someone who needs help and assistance now the messed up part about this I can't get into it um John Oliver's got great episodes on this on the Sackler family and their explicit I mean they're explicit Denial in their marketing to doctors about the prescriptions of opioids as a solution to other addiction and pain problems that it was not addictive and that it wouldn't cause social harm it just didn't make any sense listen back in the day when people were concerned about getting people off of alcohol there was a prohibitionist organization that sent heroin and packets around because they believed heroin was better than alcohol this stuff happens all the time it's just not clear to me that addiction is something that's going to end it's just how does society respond to addiction here's a little bit on the opioid crisis but this is really a good example of how it functions both as remedy poison and then it becomes scapegoat we scapegoat China we scapegoat places where it comes from communities that it happens in people that use it um all the rest of it anyways this is New York Times the opioid epidemic it's the deadliest drug crisis killing about 90 Americans every day roughly the same number as car crashes here are short answers to some key questions about the crisis what exactly is an opioid opioids are a class of drugs that interact with opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain they regulate pain and affect the brain's reward or pleasure system which can make people feel high that makes opioids powerful painkillers but also extremely addictive so what is the crisis about the current crisis started in the 1990s with the overprescription of opioid painkillers like Oxycontin over the next decade a growing number of people became dependent on these drugs and for many what started with pills grew into a heroin addiction then in 2014 potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl began entering the drug Supply in large amounts where's the crisis most severe it's worse in the midwest Appalachia and New England but it really is a national problem synthetic opioids are continuing to enter new markets especially in the Northeast and South why has it gotten so much worse in recent years decades of opioid over prescription and influx of cheap heroin and the emergence of fentanyl a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin shouldn't we just stop prescribing opioids not necessarily opioids have improved the quality of life for millions of people particularly cancer patients and those with acute pain and suddenly removing access to opioids from those who are dependent on them to function could easily push people to more dangerous opioids like heroin or counterfeit pills so what can be done there are many variables but any solution would require controlling the distribution of prescription opioids expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and making naloxone an overdose antidote more accessible in addition more controversial ideas like drug checking services or supervised injection sites may be necessary to slow the rise in overdose deaths it's really interesting how we want to keep people alive but we're not sure how much we're willing to do in order to ensure that um all right I'll move on to the next one might as well right now so thinking about disability or different I preferred like different abilities or ableism or abilities in a global context we have to go through the relatively recent U.N convention on the rights of personal disabilities push for inclusion or Equitable treatment but it's still framed as largely individual and medical issue rather than political or cultural concern I don't know how much I want States dealing with like even with that opioid discussion um you can see how we we get a prohibitionist regime very quickly right well let's just block it off we know that drugs won the War on Drugs we have very little evidence that prohibition regimes are effective in the long run um and they cause lots of harm in the short run um that I mean the U.S prison system is a direct relationship to the the War on Drugs right um the mass incarceration right and that whole industry around it so thinking about this then is it it falls in this long tradition of of this need to categorize regulate and control bodies um the social creation of what ability is right there's still all this from the research I'm doing in the military there's this notion of kind of universal service and the idea that that we need people who are are physically capable of doing things in order to be well for certain jobs yes but if you are working in the I.T in the military you probably just need somebody who's going to be able to do it um and that doesn't have anything to do with your physical capabilities right um and so these these Notions about how we create what abilities are needed is largely um framing there's also very specific neurotypical framings of the public and then some you know this is these different ways in which we're starting to acknowledge the ways in which we could be differently um the problem of course is representation right um it's speaking for others particularly those and this has always been the case those who don't have the capacity or ability to speak becomes very highly contentious right um who has the right to speak does that mean that if you don't have the right does that fall to your parents how do we decide that should the state intervene at how do how do we come to those questions when this involves children who should be responsible and what obligations do we have and so um the the textbook then really takes the UN to task for its Fabian socialists assumptions right Fabian socialism again remember it's not attacking the issue head on it's trying to starve out the issue by talking about it over and over again but without specifically telling us how to fix it who's responsible and how it's getting worse or better right it's just bringing it up I'm just bring it up I'm bringing I'm raising awareness right um loves raising awareness even if it's raising awareness causes measurable harm raising awareness becomes the goal and so the impacts of War poverty racial capitalism environment as the producers of uh disablement I mean it costs what like three dollars to put a land mine down and about two to three thousand dollars to remove them and they're all over southeast Asia and they contribute directly to all sorts of of different abilities and and disabilities from the the cost of an ongoing the ongoing costs of a war that ended 50 years ago that actually accomplished very little except Bruce has a book called the right to maim that when we stop doing body counts after the Vietnam War um what we try to do then is not record deaths but we try to injure each other it's really messed up it has really messed up attitudes about how somehow being disabled is as good as says um achieving Victory and so that's kind of yeah it's an interesting concept I don't have time to get into it here but the ways in which we still frame Warfare through ability and disabilities is very kind of dominant um and so the name of the book is the right to maim and kill um all right so in uh 2011 disability is framed as like increasing the burden on States rather than rights or inclusion you can see this immediately like that's why the far command is used because your language that you use in relation to these issues is absolutely political there's no way around it you can't not assess it there is no neutral position on this right going back to stuff we can talk about you going to have to be contentious I'm sorry you might not want the contentious you might not like the contentious but it's there and it's going to be there every time you speak um and so you know these ideas of framing things in terms of disability adjusted life years to calculate productivity due to Lost disability I mean productivity is a gross metric in and of itself because uh um socially reproductive work doesn't count as productivity even though it's required for all societies um productivity you know uh if we shut something down lost productivity is the biggest claim used over and over again by dominant groups to justify why we can't do this that or the other it will undermine productivity we can't have this event we can't have this parade you can't have more holidays because it'll impact productivity a productivity is a is a mechanism of like making people work in ways that dominant groups want them to right and so we also monetize disability um so I've been dealing with this for years with my mom's software because she was a medical transcriptionist and she had to use software on her Windows system uh that was a just abominably bad outrageously expensive because the cnib will end up like subsidizing costs for it so there's this whole economy around overpriced goods for people uh with different abilities that comes from their difference and so this famously was contentious around the fidget Spinners right when something that was used by one Community became popular it became ubiquitous which in one way was good but in other ways and everybody forgot why it was in the first place which is fine right like we're all okay if everybody gets the benefit of something that's the premise of a public good we've just forgotten the value of them and so there's a lot of inability to to think about this except in terms of drain on organizations families stuff like that and so this is this is what the textbook's calling out in this world who World Bank report when the more than one billion people live with some form of disability and can't they just live um nearly uh considered difficulties functioning okay but that's not their problem that's society not providing resources for them uh in the years ahead disability with greater concern because its prevalence is on the ride well yes we're older population we're getting older we're going to have more issues aging populations higher risk of disability ordered people as well as The Chronic health conditions diabetes cardiovascular these disaster yes yes we could link this to all sorts of ways in which Industries have gotten lots of money by making sure that we adopt attitudes and opinions and Lifestyles that are unhealthy and so thinking about the tacit message here is that like the ways in which this is framed in terms of you know how their employment rates are lower and how um a school children out of school may have disabilities and all this it's these are problems that haven't been framed in terms of States having to give Solutions because the UN doesn't want to do that and so this idea then of of um you know removing physical barriers making Health Care affordable training health care workers and with rights-based and invested in services such as as rehab are all kind of ways in which they want to produce a certain outcome but will not are not willing to say it um and so this idea of like one in seven people experiencing this is it's just a kind of it's a common issue of everyone that we either think about or don't right like eyeglasses apparently my eyeglasses are a thing there are lots of innovating ways in which we're trying to like I won't get into it to innovate our way out of these problems but often those Innovations are just new sources of revenue that people haven't thought of before and so it becomes this way of of targeting people individuals as sites of growth for more development and money which I guess is okay if it provides everybody with that good but if it becomes an expense for one particular Community or that Community is seen as a site of new accumulation because they have their because they're differently abled in some way that's also weird and so that's what I'm saying there is no way to to come at this issue and not be kind of grossed out it's why it's it's this the farcamon right it's there it's it's one the other it's one of the three
 so the externalization of borders takes a bunch of different forms um Visa policies which countries you require visa from and which ones you don't it's a way of discouraging travel discouraging those groups from um participating just doing tourism visiting um it's a form of remote control right in managing movement from a distance so temporary foreign workers so when we have uh when we want home care we open up Visa offices in places like the Philippines or um anywhere in I think it's Malaysia as well we open those up and make it easier for people to access we also designate certain areas safe and not safe which then means that and this is the there's a whole bunch of Contra services around safe third parties but the idea that if you're coming from a place that we have designated safe then for example you your um claimed to be a refugee is going to be harder to to make right um and so this idea of you know putting visa requirements on some people means they can't so freely freely travel um this idea of saying that you're from a safe country therefore we're not going to even process your um Refugee claim or we're going to say you have to process in the place that you first encountered so one of the controversies about the safe third party agreement was Canada the U.S entered into this agreement that said that you have to if you're applying for Refugee status make the application the country you first encounter or whatever it was um but that included like flights so if you flew through Atlanta over the U.S that would be the place you have to do your your application even if you arrive in Canada and so that you would be rejected and you'd be told you have to go apply you have to go to the border and you have to apply in the U.S and so this idea of push bodies around is this a way in which you can externalize the borders you don't actually have to deal with your border because you've had agreement with another state that they're going to tell that person that they have to go somewhere else to deal with the problem right um and so when we think about these things all states do this I don't want to just uh level some groups out we can talk about Trudeau and the Syrian refugee crisis the targeting of women and children which in theory is great but in practice you're doing the thing again right like you're you're designating which bodies get to to literally live and die based on Notions about what you think looks appropriate as if that the status of the people who need the protection has to do with only their now it's not to say there aren't differential impacts of fighting and conflict especially on uh women and children and minority groups not the case but the idea of us designating which groups are are to be chosen for protection is weird right it's it's weird it involves this it's it's the height of privilege is able to do that um and so in terms of the adjudication of these issues many of these issues fall to the executive which is the and we'll get into this later in the course uh we'll get into this with um the executive I.E the president of the Prime Minister because traditionally Foreign Relations deal with one leader to another the the rule of Kings right Kings enter into agreements with one another so what this means is that the executive has wide Authority and latitude in making decisions that impact things that are outside of your country now not your citizens your citizens have rights but decisions you make that impact your non-citizens totally within the purview so the interesting part let's say it's interesting for sake of benefit um the interesting part about Trump's ban on Nationals from muslim-majority countries remember you also called Haiti a country um direct quote um was the idea and he removed the temporary protected status for Haitians that's what he he was doing when he was complaining about that the classic way in which the U.S has opposed communism in Cuba has been the wet foot dry foot policy so if you are a Cuban who hits American Shores you have one foot that's wet one foot that's dry you get status you get some form of status will give you protection you can come here it's a strategy against the other those other places it was also extended to Haiti especially post earthquake but the idea of this temporary protected status for Haitians was what Trump was rebelling against when he said these things but because he said those things is the only reason that he wasn't able to pass his his uh his literal Muslim ban um the Supreme Court ruled that if not for his statements that were overtly showing the intent was not to pick the countries but the people he would have been able to pass it the executive has that authority to do so it can absolutely designate countries as threats or not threats to National Security but because Trump had had said publicly that he wanted to ban them because they were Muslim not because they were the states he wasn't able to and do that and so there are some mechanisms that can constrain what the executive can do in relation to other people's bodies but not a ton because it's up to the individual state to protect their citizens and it's not up to me as a state to predict you see how it's it really becomes citizen Foreigner citizen Foreigner right um it really reinforces so borders are not disappearing globalization did not bring the end to borders they're just being refashioned in new ways so we're just thinking of ways of doing them differently new agreements new ways that we either push or indicate that we're being tough on things so we get less Refugee claims you move down your your ranking in terms of the best places to live you get less applications those types of things and so this idea is very much citizenship and borders are still very much defined by the territorial sovereign state they involve this form of untaxed inheritance by which you get based on where you were born which is very hard to move you if you are lucky enough to have a state that recognizes the blood Quantum of a grandparent you can have it conferred through you but all of this stuff about blood and whose blood is it's weird there's a weird blood politics around citizenship I didn't really get to talk about um and so you understand it though right like they did this notion of certain States establishing that you are one of us because of X Y or Z or not one of us because of X Y or Z and so globalization in migration are forcing us to think about these in new ways I'll probably try to find a tick tock dealing with the idea of climate refugees because climate refugees are going to end up with uh stateless people who don't have a state because it's literally underwater so this raises interesting questions can you be a citizen of a state that doesn't exist you can get digital citizenship in Estonia because Estonia does all this cool cyber stuff you can apply for digital citizenship so you can run businesses and have your place of citizenship be Estonia doesn't really Grant the same stuff though there are other states though if you have like 250 000 in cash you can come in right now and buy a property and live there right so there are all ways in which we can think about who has access and how and then what that means so I don't know what it means to be a citizen of a state that doesn't exist but we are increasingly going to move to that and we're going to have to say do other states have an obligation because micro States and small island States certainly did not contribute to global climate change they are going to Bear the brunt of it and the question becomes what happens to those bodies and who's responsible for those Buddies the current system we have right now says they're foreigners and so it's up to the state to be responsible for them even if it's underwater oh good times because nobody wants to touch the regime and the the regimes that we have in place have defined citizenship and still leave all the power and capacity to the state and we're not interested we have obligations we have legal obligations that we have to enforce through our States but we don't have legal obligations to do anything then adjudicate whether or not somebody's claim is valid and it was ruled by a one of the human rights councils that somebody's claim I think it was towards New Zealand I can't remember the reference right now um the idea that um uh climate change had resulted in a change of livelihood which was a threat as a justification to apply for Refugee status is not immediate enough and so at some point it will be immediate but right now it's not and because it's not right now we don't consider that status as a well-founded fear of persecution which could make you a refugee because you're not being persecuted you're just dying um and so this produces these weird political nature of borders I don't think covet did I'm pretty sure 911 had something to do with that um I think Daniel Dracut you work at a book out just before 9 11 that said the end of borders right globalization of the under borders and then oops um and so this idea then of having things I'm not even talking about though is but temporary migrant workers I mean particularly with covid uh we're we're stuck in quarters and work in close circumstances where it's very difficult um to not get coveted and so they were considered essential I guess because you don't want your crops to rot but at the same time didn't have the same protections we would Grant or the same recognition we Grant to others um so yeah borders closed uh to travel but not to trade well in some ways yes in some ways no part of the supply chain Mix-Ups that were happening was because we were sending empty cargo containers back and full ones in those type of problems that come from that and so um that's just to say that when we're thinking about these they're deeply political they go to the core about who belongs and who doesn't and then how you decide who should belong and who doesn't
 so we can talk borders [Music] borders are performative there's all ways in which they're performative but the main one being that they signal to the population levels of security and they become a way in which you can securitize the border so back to the premise of securitization you say there's a threat at the border your populace accept or rejects that threat and they're willing to do things because of that they're accepting of it for a time I don't know what your framing is about I think it's in response to events I guess so 911 was a big event we were very concerned about terrorism we did all sorts of things good and bad as a consequence of that then but over time we just have waned in our interest in that so even this chapter frames the question of borders through the covid situation right so we frame borders performatively based on the threats that we perceive at the time right um the problem of course is that borders are not a place of security they're a place of perception of security there's all sorts of reasons why Mark Salter he's got a bunch of TED Talks he's a uh he was at Ottawa I think he's still around um talks about this quite extensively but the idea of a passport as a foundation of security is just not great a passport is just a document that makes high truth claims and what do we mean by that it just means that it refers to other documents that you assume have been vetted by the state that gave that looked at them in order to give you a document that you're Now using to let somebody in or out of a country right so when somebody comes to you at the border and gives you a passport you have seconds to take that passport and do something with it so if you don't have let's say cyber infrastructure a back-end database a big list or a surveillance regime that has everybody in a database that you can relate that passport to passport is not very useful it's just a document that you're assuming that because of that country takes security seriously we can trust it that country doesn't take security seriously we can't trust it that's why it has truth claims if the passport is for example let's pick Saudi Arabia a Saudi Arabian passport you would have questions about the background and checking they were doing when for example they uh were the bulk of the 911 hijackers right so you would say when you're looking at the next passport I'm not sure that this document has high truth claims so your allies generally are ones that you trust more and the other problem is is that you have to trust that their security apparatus is actually looking at the documents properly so um you know there's all sorts of events the Millennium bomber was was let in on a fake Canadian passport the the physical thing he was holding was a real passport issue by the government the documents he used to get the passport were fake so you're hoping that your agency does a good job checking the documents that you used in order to get your passport that you're presenting when you enter to another border this could all be solved simply if all the states cooperated and they had a central database of passports and everybody could refer to everybody else and look at what documents were there but we don't want to do that right socialism some type of global government this type of stuff so so we're going to have a bad system of checking the security at the border because you've got a hope that you when you take that passport from whatever country you have intelligence from that country to assess the veracity of that passport um you also got to hope that there's no bureaucracy there so the 911 hijackers are given visas for Flight Training six months after the attacks this idea then that we have a system that efficiently operates at scale and scope for every person who is moving everywhere on the planet is just not simply a thing um you know Donald Trump famously utilized this idea that he was building a border wall walls don't work I mean maybe they worked Berlin Wall might have worked um people dig under them always have a Chapo right El Chapo you know stick up in any prison he digs his way out um I've got lots of pictures of this I should have put them in of just people you know walking over crawling over using drones to put your drugs over borders walls are great symbolic efforts they are horrible for the environment uh all they do is make it harder for people to move um they basically it's like a flow of water right sure you can Dam it up but if the backlog gets too strong it's going to push its way through so that's why I said it's similar to The War on Drugs you're going to have a war on migration but you're just going to make it more difficult you're going to kill more people but it's not going to produce better outcomes um and so I don't want to get I said I wouldn't get into it the underlying premise the family separation Pro policy is this it it's that we didn't for a while um have to detain people for a long period of time just because they presented themselves at the border to make a claim that they want to end that they have Refugee status whatever um when we decide to start detaining them because as it's still in the books and Biden never got rid of this because of the national security threat posed specifically by the Public Health crisis that was the covid-19 pandemic it allowed us to put them into places to adjudicate their claims the problem is is how do you adjudicate the claim of a baby how do you prove I would listen as a father how would I prove that my daughter because we have different last names because if I want to get into it anyways uh it's not anything complicated if it was a boy was getting my last name if we had a girl that was getting my daughter's last name and that's just how we went so whatever so I was always I still to this day don't know how I can prove that my daughter is mine um if someone challenges it I guess I'd have to have her birth certificate on me but who carries a birth certificate around because it's literally a piece of paper that if I lose it it's a real pain to get another one and so this idea then of people showing up who have traveled thousands of miles having all of their documentation in a legible way for those that are adjudicating the legibility of those claims and that your baby because you're fleeing a place that probably you weren't in a good relationship with did or didn't give you a piece of paper to prove that that baby is yours is going to result in separations right that's just going to it's going to be the adjudication so I'm not going to get too much into it that's the border wall sure you can build whatever you want build a wall that that you know Saudi Arabia trying to build that City that's a wall it's not for people it's for designers um the problem and why I say that border security isn't really a thing is that it's not really a thing it is something that we do um that there is a later one the failure rate for example they do stress tests the TSA the airport um fails in the high 80s has a high 80 failure rate I think Josh Hawley one of the U.S Republicans has got caught three times to bring live loaded weapons on planes um all it's doing is trying to capture something in 90 seconds if your security requires somebody to take a visual inspection of someone else in 90 seconds that's not really security that's theater you need intelligence Services you need back ends you need to be able to know who's coming before they get there so that you can do the proper intelligence and background checks so when they get to the Border you're ready to have them so this is what we've seen the externalization of borders it it it makes sense if you're actually interested in security then you have to do the intelligence work on the back end and you have to have a system in place so that when someone shows up you know who they are and that you've already assessed them and done your check and so this is what we're talking about shifting borders now I can't even get into all the problems with this the Borderlands has given in the U.S ice because they want to be cool immigration control enforcement a 200 mile swath of of uh territory on each side of the Border where they can operate with legality and treat it as a border situation which is to say that if the bulk of Canadian population is within 200 miles the U.S border the U.S can challenge your citizenship in those regimes as immigration enforcement not at the border so if you're operating within that 200 mile swath which the bulk of Canada's population tends to go in that and same with the the U.S uh all the population going back and forth to Mexico does that they can be challenged for having their and do you have proof of your citizenship on you at all times a a state-based document like a driver's license doesn't isn't citizenship identity you'd have to have your passport on you at all times and so what this allows them to do is create this precariousness or the shifting borders where anybody in that border Zone that Border Lands as they're called doesn't have constitutional protections anymore as traditionally defined because the border is 200 miles wide and so what we're actually getting is is efforts to deal with security through the pushing out of the borders and increasingly this kind of layered risk or mitigated risk we don't the borders aren't going to be secure but what we do try to do is assess the veracity of the risks and develop screening systems so that by the time you get to the Border all the security has been assessed and so it's more about preparedness than prevention it's more about pre-screening it's perfect security is on a sustainable uh layered security is necessary so this for example this is U.S Aviation Security intelligence Customs Joint Task Force no fly lists uh crew vetting Viper whatever the hell that is canines literal dogs uh Behavior detection travel Document chapter checkpoints check baggage Transportation Checkers random employee screening bomb appraisal detectors Federal Air Marshals Federal flight decks uh trained fight clue Law Enforcement Officers hard and cockpit doors and passengers that's a lot of stuff now you're assuming all of those actors are good actors that can't be bribed they don't do anything wrong they don't make any mistakes that's why border security is absolutely about mitigating risk but it's not about providing actual security it's about reducing the risks it's about making things reasonably mitigated right rather than producing something like a secure border and so borders are a last week zone of Defense um really the only way to do this is to increasingly restrain Freedom by having things like develop a database on you develop your backgrounds develop your uh history make sure that your passport refers to other documents and that we have a big paper trail that can do that and so with all of this involved those population that 50 of the US population that never applies for a passport never leaves the country experiences citizenship quite differently than anybody doing any of this and those groups are going to look much like a certain type of group that would travel and another type that won't and so we get kind of tourists and terrorists we get these two forms of security and then we get Management systems for them like the Nexus system which allows you to basically pay more get access to a better system that pre-does all the pre-checks does the background checks does Deeper levels of security before you get to the border so you experience the Border more quickly than those who don't have access to those things and so this idea of intelligence rights are always going to be intention and this externalization of the borders is going to allow you to do things if you have the means to do so differently and so the border is experienced differently and it's not one form of security it's based on all those criteria and those people who move more that's my nice way of saying they have elements of foreign it's just so bad that's how we determine degrees of security and of course these are going to find it follow very hierarchical form so if the bulk of the population never moves and has a passport looks a certain way it doesn't have a passport it looks a certain way that group when they get passports are also being adjudicated by people who look like them at those places of screening and so you can see how this happens
 okay so citizenship would seem straightforward except it really isn't um it's the idea of formal status within a national state but it becomes really complicated really quick because your status then determines your rights and obligations and I'm not talking about people whatever I'm talking about what Hannah Arendt talked about she said that after World War II when they drew the lines of the borders around Europe there were a whole bunch of people who ended up on the wrong side of a line through no fault of their own and so the idea then is is it's not that and she very specifically says borders created refugees not the other way around right so the idea of making something where you've got status then when that line is drawn the people who are on the right side of the line who the state designates and recognizes as being read on that sideline then get rights but if you are one who the state doesn't designate um you don't get right so this has happened a bunch of times to talk about it in the the book a bit um where states have tried to say well we're going to revoke this person's citizenship um we're going to send them back to a state where we think they come from and that other state I don't know who that is so what happens to those people they literally don't have they also don't have anybody to protect their rights so it becomes this very precarious situation is that um this has happened at the past and this is largely what the emergence of the concentration camp with the boa war was the idea that that people are in a space that is controlled by someone where they don't have any rights and so this idea then is that it's both a limited and exclusionary state has the ability to Grant citizenship and interact with it so you have a right to freely travel but the state is under no obligation to give you a passport so good luck with that right it's and so the implementation of your your rights is always going to be determined based on whether or not you know that state has decided you have a status now for me to Grant you this that or the other and so um you know this border is critical in every sense because who is inside and outside of it then matters in in terms of these so it's an interesting concept of like what citizenship is if you don't interact with the state and so like back in you know what is that 1989 most Americans like less than 10 percent of Americans had a passport it wasn't until you know the last what is that 10 years where you even have 30 with the passport which is to say then your citizenship status was never really in question per se if you were a settler group that had long-standing ties and relationships in a community because in many cases you would need the the referent point so you might have a birth certificate and you might have a Social Security number and those things might result in you having a driver's license or you could have just went and got a driver's license before they required those things right remember credit we could get into this the racialized stuff of credit credit ratings didn't exist in the 80s you had a job you go into a bank you say I want a house they give you a loan right like they didn't do this kind of deep background stuff a lot of stuff was based on status where your your respect in the community is what established things um it drives me nuts whenever I'm doing reference letters and they ask for your full legal name your full legal name is whatever the hell you make it and this is well established in law it goes back to some like guy who went around I don't know his name was was butch or something and everybody knew him as Butch and so some bank got an agreement where it didn't have Butch on the title like well this isn't the loan I don't owe you any money blah blah blah and they took him to court it's like no it's what's reasonable right if everybody knows you as something that's your name that's your legal name for all intents and purposes so to try to to try to make status something more complicated than that it's it's what is reasonable in a court of law right um and so you could do this over and over again this is you know your citizenship it did why don't if you want a passport you have to pass a citizenship test if you don't have to do that to get a passport what is your proof of citizenship and why is it that we have a higher threshold for those who want status than those who have it and so like you could do this just you click that link and go to it see if you pass a citizenship test and this is one of the what are the responsibilities of citizenship getting a job making money raising family paying taxes mowing your lawn voting elections voting Municipal options joining political party getting a job obeying the law drawing safely picking up later caring for the environment not littering paying taxes obeying while helping others respecting others all those sound reasonable but obeying the law taking responsibility for oneself and one's family helping others in the community voting and elections serving on a jury protecting and enjoying our heritage environment you got it right can we disqualify people who've never served on a jury I've never served on a jury so I is it that I'm capable of serving on a jury is that what does it and so this is the problem is that we have real struggles when it comes to defining we can say the word that when we have to implement it it becomes very messy it's a slippery concept we still not entirely sure what it means and this idea we we don't have it it was Paul Martin senior that introduced the bill that that we have it in 1946 well we were a settler State long before that listen back in the day there there was no official border between Canada and the U.S not there was a formal line but like people if the the economy was bad in like Wisconsin they come over and get a job in Canada and people in Canada when the economy is bad in Canada they go over to Wisconsin like there wasn't any effort to establish like if you lived in a community you can establish your community Through reciprocal relationships with others there oh they know that guy I know who he is right so those things get established through forms of like you can call that a background check but it's not really right um so we still are struggling to describe what it means to be a citizen I don't know why I don't have to pass tests when I get a passport I know people have pest tests they want to be a citizen so if I want citizenship should I have best test seems pretty simple I mean basic kind of I don't know if we have standards for people that we say this is what it means to be us then why don't we have to follow those standards right it's it's like we're we're literally grandfathered in right so and even that concept of being grandfathered in I don't know anyways so because the slippery concept um what category categorizes inclusion exclusion or Community um is uh largely social and then comes with all the problems I mean I I will not I'm not going to deal with kids and cages at the borders because I find it emotionally overwhelming and it's not it's so emotionally overwhelming we can't have a reasonable discussion over it I've got lots of examples of like former veteran U.S Marines who have their driver's license on them in Michigan get picked up as illegals and deported even though they have their like their veterans card and their driver's license on them it's bureaucracy the instantly introduced some type of bureaucracy you can blame the bureaucracy when the bureaucracy doesn't function and so this idea of having a right also requires the government to enforce that right and enforce it in a way that doesn't reflect power and privilege good luck with that um and so there's full participation in practice is kind of limited um it's been a case you can still do it in the U.S if you are um or if you're not a full citizen you can participate in you can join the American Military and then apply for full citizenship you were told you would get it it's never quite as simple as that um Starship Troopers has this as a premise it it's an interesting parody fascist movie um but one of the premises is you're you don't get full citizenship status until you serve in the military which is an interesting concept right that that there has to be some ways in which you participate so if we trace it back to ancient Greece and Rome we already as we talked throughout the course those people who have through the division of labor were of such higher status that they thought they could rule and and be ruled right participate in ruling um so one who has ruled and ruled um and so we know the citizenship from its Inception in this framework in the western tradition has been about excluding uh women slave foreigners and Resident aliens right um it's framed as a civic duty of Elites and so it's always always done this um the citizenship as rights informed by 17th century liberalism American French revolutions tries to establish an equality fraternity and Liberty as the basis but we still have gender and race as an impediment to both of those so if we're going to do this this if we're going back to these origins of the ruler and the ruled it means you would think citizenship means you have to participate in a political process so why don't we do things like Australia where you're fined if you don't vote or put like real penalties on your lack of participation in the process or if you're not going to do it then you lose some citizenship right so we don't really understand why it is that these different systems say the same word when they Implement them radically different right um you know is it easy to be obligated um is it is it better to have leisure time than have to participate politically I you know you will might get this but those of us who do politics can be kind of insufferable about politics not everybody wants to to think through these citizenship obligations and I don't know if everybody should I don't know if we want to referendum on every issue I I think it'd be exhausting and I'm not sure we do that hence we there's got to be some dynamics of representation I just don't know what they should look like now the problem of this framework is is this idea of known genealogy so for the longest time in France your social status was your citizenship you you were known by others and you could be acknowledged by others and and treated as someone of respect and that was what granted you citizenship so you generally had a known genealogy so you have to have social ranking you're a patriarch a warrior and then literally a master of the labor of others normally slave is the model of our system now this still exists in our system what the hell is a senate in the U.S it gives equal representation to California which is the fourth biggest economy in the world and Wisconsin which has what like 50 000 people in it it's a totally inequitable structure we have the same thing here the the Canadian Senate which Trudeau said we were going to get rid of which I never did um the Canadian Senate is very much this model it's the idea that you are appointed into a role that oversees and puts checks and balances on this system um It's Not Elected right um and so when we problematize the citizenship far enough this is where I just ran into this is the citizenship book from MIT press not some wonky press this is MIT in 2019. and they use the arguments here citizenship has always been explicitly exclusionary hierarchical sexist and uh racist I mean yeah if you want to put that fight a point on it um violent totalitarian and pre-modern pre-modern is interesting here and so it it is carryover and there's a whole bunch written on this and a whole bunch even the authors used in this chapter this week um that are referenced have written extensively on this um because it's capricious and random in its assignment which means you can't get it based on Merit per se um it actually doesn't have that we've got the data I'll show it in a second but it's less than three three percent ever change citizenship in their lifetime so you what you get when you're born is what you get it's through no fault of your own it's just wherever you happen to be born right um it's a glory uh glory in its sexism and racism well I mean it has this long tradition of those who have the right to make decisions um and it's the opposite of political answer emancipation because it is assigned to you and it's very hard if not impossible to change or get rid of right um and so you can do it that way or you could do it as a story of belonging um this idea that it reinforces individualism statehood dignity equality and human worth if you if you have that so back to what that that test was saying about what citizenship should be um these are just this that's the egality Liberty egalitarian fraternity right so the principles of it in the social contract theory which is still a lot what we use we've talked about before but it's this idea of this consensual and contractual relationship that there this idea of citizens consent is the basis of political Authority the problem of course is is that we know that citizens weren't everyone um and that's still the case so I'll just give you the case a Doha we can talk about a minute but 80 of the population that lives in Doha at any given time goes up and down and prior to the World Cup it was much higher um the bulk of the population in the country doesn't have citizenship like 80 doesn't because they're foreign workers right um and so this idea then that the people who participate to the economy of the country don't have citizenship very much is in this long line of tradition right and it's a pretty simple claim because if your Qatari you can just say they're not Qatari they're South Asian and normally Indian or Pakistani and you just say that they're not us and done I'm not obligated to them they don't get rights whatever right and so this is this weird um Foundation that we elect representatives delegate Powers abide by their decisions um but they should ultimately be responsible to us but that's only if we've got mechanisms by which to do that right and so citizenship as rights then um isn't automatic from these systems of governance so the systems of governance we have in place are from much older models part of the reason that we are able to fully participate in our political systems that we're full citizens now has to do with like things like World War one where what throws us into World War One are a series of packs made in secret by leaders who are not accountable in any way to their populist Kings and and leaders and all the rest of it and then everyone's thrown into war and thrown into war like not because you had any say in the process but in the case of Canada Canada was part of the BNA act so Canada did not have the capacity to set independent foreign policy in World War One and so when Britain declares war Canada is at War and then the Canadian population gets conscripted into war so you are twice removed from having any say in this system and so in World War one we've got 625 000 serving World War II at 1.1 million serving we have a population 12 million this is a massive contribution that in the first case they didn't have any choice over we had literal riots in 1917 because in particular the french-speaking population of Canada is like what like you're conscripting us for a war for the Brits like what's going on here and so the democratization of foreign policy the textbook frames it as happening after World War II you've just basically trained your entire populace and how to fight and they come back and then you try to say like you've been through Horrors and we're gonna make those decisions without you no and so this is that tradition right so all of those people in World War one and two fought and died under this flag that under a British flag which is you have citizenship but not kind of yours kind of not right like you're you're part of the Commonwealth and so you are citizens of the queen that doesn't have a full say or autonomy over your decisions and decision making so this idea then is is shifting from a citizen model that is is bestowed on you from a monarch to a citizen model where you have rights and obligations as Citizens in that state emerges largely post-world War II and so it's just this idea that you have to have we have to be able to to have some individual freedom and to do that we need some type of civil rights like I should be able to vote right um especially if I'm being asked to if I'm being taxed like I should have some form um you should have some political rights the right to vote and run for office um and then um social rights and so this is really post World War II like I like to frame it in the reverse they're like these were granted by the state I'm like well you've got a populist that you just sent off to war they just came back and they're pretty clear on what Warfare is maybe you shouldn't um kick them while they're down you know so this raises interesting questions this this came up in in this period this was one of the proposed after World War one around World War One this idea of the Ludlow amendment in the U.S was that uh wait a minute if if you've got conscription or you're asking us to go to war shouldn't we have a referendum on Declarations of War except in cases where you've been attacked first right if if the state is choosing to go to war and I'm the one who literally has to go to war shouldn't you do that um there was also like an offshoot which is like if you vote for war should that member that representative immediately be conscripted into Warfare too like if you're willing to do it you're willing to put us on the line you should do that now all this has changed with professional armies and there isn't the same obligation but this idea of citizenship as rights is like well no why do we get rights and why do some get rights and some don't and so this idea of of Law and Parliament like co-opting this participation adds this social Dimension to rights and so social rights gain prominence Canada Post World War II just not randomly like this idea that you fought and died for this country um probably means that country should should take care of you right like at a basic level like I think we need to massively expanded veterans rights it will cost Canadians money but you should probably do that because you've asked for things and if you're asking them to do that and you're expecting unlimited liability like they're putting their life on the line probably should get better benefits than you know working somewhere else right um anyways neither here nor there uh so so adding this social Dimension to citizenship then brings in all these other questions right because if you're providing Goods then you're saying that we are designating certain groups for certain things and other groups maybe not getting as many things especially if they don't have citizenship in the case let's just do it indigenous communities you know the the right to vote right until 75. um you're still got residential schools operating until the 90s so this idea then of public education universal healthcare public um housing income Security Programs absolutely are distributed um their your ability to access them is very much tied into your citizenship um in the Canadian case this was become a marker of identity right so our social Provisions our Universal Health Care is tied to the Canadian identity why in 2004 Tommy Douglas voted Canada's greatest Canadian that's why there's a large allergic reaction to the privatization of health care because we see it as American right we see it as an undermining of the Canadian the distinct Canadian identity which at some level the only thing we have is this now there are states in the US that actually have it it's this they don't have it at the federal level that's Tommy Douglas so um citizenship as status then raises a bunch of questions um who is born a citizen and who can has the right to access citizenship um how should we think about it um how do we think about migration this question isn't really unpacked I I like this this is from the readings I did these are more concrete examples so citizenship has status then um is the status of fully belonging to any Community it used to be assigned strictly and for Life the instances of purses being coming naturalized or converting across the world is less than two percent so this is a largely entrenched hierarchical uh non-merit-based system um because 98 of citizenship never changes it just doesn't um even if you look at all the migration they put the numbers like oh if you look at a percentage like three percent right um and so it's a signed at Birth not chosen and will be remain unchanged for life so this stuff like this happens right guitar citizenship allows the majority um to uh justify this 88 it was 88 of foreign workers the majority to do this to oppress these foreign workers because they're foreign workers they don't have full status they don't have full rights they don't get the full protections of the state they don't have the same coverages and they the state can designate because they're not from here and which they they are right I used to work at York in um in financial services and one time one of the higher ups came and I just I had to do I was doing the website for the prices for domestic and international students I'm like well how are we setting the international students well I said whatever I want uh whatever sounds reasonable let's round the numbers up let's do it that way right like totally arbitrary where there's all sorts of legislation on how specifically you calculate it for those who are domestic when those are interested you know whatever we'll make it up so here's an example of one um so he's born his parents took him when he was three months old um uh to Minnesota he's never left Minnesota he has continually been there all the time and he has two sisters who were born there um who have full citizenship rights because they're born in the U.S um he has no right to remain in the U.S and every interaction he has where someone can question his status is potential his deportation to a place he has no relationship to has never been to and can be arbitrarily taken out whenever he just happens to run into the wrong person so in terms of Rights they are conferred by your state to you so both of his sisters have full rights but he doesn't this is 2.3 million people in the U.S are living in this status right so this is why status is the word all the time because he has overtly done nothing specifically that he is responsible for because you cannot hold I mean we should not hold babies responsible we should not make toddlers stand in court and defend themselves put that as happy anyways I said I wouldn't talk about kids and cages gets me too upset anyways the idea here is that person has made no overt act at any point in their life to do anything but participate in the community in which they're born lived and raised or Not Sorry lived and raised not born um and as a consequence of that then they're at constant threat of deportation to a place they've never never encountered right so their full rights in that Society are always going to be constrained by a decision that wasn't theirs this in any other context would be be a punishment without proper adjudication of a crime which under a liberal Society shouldn't happen right but because you're not in that liberal Society it can happen to you and so this is a long history right so dust in the Dutch East Indies if these women were marrying Colonial people even as Dutch they lose their status they didn't have the right to return When Yugoslavia collab if you didn't inform the Slovenian state of where you were they don't have any record of you you don't live there and so it's changed a bit but in the past so under George W bush I just know this data um the bulk of uh illegal immigrants in the U.S where Visa overstays which meant they undertook no overt action to to create the situation where they if you want to call the criminal criminal but they didn't take any overt acts so there was no intent on their part often this is Visa delays processing bureaucracy slows down or they don't have the right status so you could say that their inability to choose that stuff but if they don't make an overt act normally crimes require an action and intent and if you don't have intent how can you be a crime so this is why many well some have argued that you can't and George W bush argued that um illegal Crossing of a border wasn't a ongoing issue because the threat to people who are framed as criminal so he or Georgia Bush argued that crossing the border wasn't an ongoing act it's like speeding if you speed are you forever a speeder and should you constantly be under threat that the state has a picture of you speeding and if they encounter you at any point they can dig up that picture and say we're throwing you in jail for you not reporting your speeding so we don't have it as an ongoing status that was changed after George W um and let's be clear deportation shut way up under Obama um Obama would love to deport people and drawing people um and so this idea um as and though it's presented as equal citizenship is never and not it cannot be neutral it always plays in the world of the policing of boundaries around the state if I am threatened that I'm in a constant state like that if I interact with police or health care or any official and that official asks for my citizenship status and then I'm immediately deported that is going to make sure that I can't fully participate in that Society um it's a Perpetual problem part of the reason the the don't ask don't tell stuff was around is that people for example would get diseases or encounter violent situations or see crimes and couldn't report them and so what it creates is basically citizenship where the social is existing and then bigger and bigger black markets right because because we Don't Legalize It right and so this famously has been called a Birthright Lottery you uh you you basically hit a lottery when you're born the ticket places you in first class business economy or outside the plane by no overt action of your own you are a baby you can't do anything about it and we can actually quantify the differences here so there's a Q and I index that talks about the value of nationality so you can just uh relate it so you can put it all together so citizenship has status we can quantify it and rank them so if you you count human development economic strength peace and stability uh the Democratic and socioeconomic Freedom the uh capacity the the weight of uh what is that self-effective freedom the capacity to travel and the weight of travel if you put them together you get a rank and so the us on this ranking is 25th and Canada was 28th we are off the top of the list and so this idea that citizenship grants you all of these things just and we understand why right like if you're a good Syrian Refuge you try to get to Germany because these have having citizenship there gives you all sorts confers all sorts of benefits that are just where you were born and nothing else and so citizenship as status then is this spectrum of those who are born into places that have a lot of capabilities and resources because wherever they were born and those who don't have that status are in constant threat of being deported back to one of those lesser ranked places and so we do this all the time we differ types of citizenship and types of status here migrant workers I see them all the time migrant workers come up they get the benefit of access to more income but they don't have all sorts of other benefits that come from Full citizenship and so they can't do as many things and they can't make as many claims and they can't demand as much stuff right not only that we have a point space system that privileges education marketable skills and language and income as ways in which you can go to the top of the queue in terms of getting status and so it's not a merit-based system it is a system that we change at our Leisure as to which of the best people around the world best we have to do it it's normative the best people around the world that we want here it goes to those more substantive questions about how to settler settlers have the right to um to close the border right like you got to come here at some point until 19 what was it whatever it was when we just find citizenship you got to come here and you got status and then we decided oh everybody is here get status and then let's close the border behind us and I'll unpack some of the problems of doing it that way um just this idea of in a settler Society closing a border is weird and so we live in a World's as a status citizenship is illiberal it goes against the idea it's landed it's the whole premise of moving from feudalism to liberalism this is the radical stuff I was talking about before was that it takes um established inherited wealth and puts it into a productive system Taxation and representation and moving out of the class system and into a market-based system was a radical framing remember capitalism was Radical because it said we're going to take those resources make them productive for our economy and make the economy bigger and everybody benefit and so the idea of having untaxed inherited wealth and the reason we still have inherited tax is the idea that it creates an illiberal Society where not everybody puts into reasonable production the capacities of that Society to undermine Society so our world today is still one where the place we were born and live and matters enormously determine as much as two-thirds of our lifetime income um and so that less than two percent that actually switches means that 98 of us get a huge amount of and this is the birthright Lottery untaxed inheritance in the status of our um citizenship and you know this is the kid because it's it's you can measure there's all sorts of things that measure which which passport's the best to have which citizenship's the best to have and so this idea of framing citizenship as a universal experience is largely framing it as an illiberal experience not one where we say those who work are the hardest and get ahead get benefit to it no it's those who have it have it and those who don't don't and that's just how we framed it and so if you want to talk about settlement I mean where would you settle it looks like our those other countries look like better places but there's no capacity to change it's either you have it or you don't someone in your family has it you can apply for it or you don't and so it's about birth it's a Birthright Lottery
 apologies that last video went um too long um you know it said I get excited about these things so this is the problem right and you get excited and well we'll see um so clearly there's a strong relationship between the border and the citizen right it's which side of a border you you were born into is what just determines your status and so that becomes integral um so this is very much tied to the westphalian understanding of the The Sovereign Nation State the ways in which um that bounding of the territorial status is what makes your citizenship yours um in that you can establish that you were born somewhere that's what gives you the status right hopefully um and so if the state exercises uh sovereignty over given uh territory it's also the population on that territory assuming that population registers with that state if you're not in that Yugoslavian situation where the state falls apart and you don't register with the right thing nobody knows who you are there was a worry for the time in the case of Brazil that the lavalasta the slums um the levellas the the there was babies being born who never encountered the state so we didn't actually have any record of them um you have to hope that your state has good record keeping in order to do this and we'll come back to the board why that matters so much for borders in a minute um and so borders are identified on maps as fixed as static has taken for granted but in reality they are very fluid porous political um you know like this idea perimeter security or the EU can set up new mechanisms where everybody gets to travel freely and then the other they can come back up again and close again conflict so if we decide we are shutting off relations with the country you can no longer get access to Iran or Russia this happens all the time and so colonialism imperialism War conflict and political settlements all Impact Through Your Capacity to access the Border borders nothing States love more than playing with fighting and defending borders um and so the problem of course is communities don't live there and territories live across them and the Heart understanding have long been there before the Border existed there's all sorts of I could put them in here they're so nerdy I can't even do them but lots of um there's a um a dude on Tick Tock that does nothing but talk about weird borders and how these weird relationships or decisions made one of the problems in particular with with this border was that it was made during one of the settlements I want to say either the War of 1812 or one of the piece of the Treaty of Versailles um set the the Canada U.S border that didn't that just like put it as a line and that actually doesn't follow the territory um accurately and so it created all of these problems that exist to this day because we put a line on our map in the wrong spot right um and so in particular for the the Mohawk territory um this idea of it being bisected uh impacts their ability to cross the border and that they have their status cards um are supposed to under treaty give them access to their territory but try to tell that to an 18 year old Border guard who just got the job and doesn't understand the long complex history of cellular colonialism right and they're they're under the idea that people are trying to get in and we got to stop it right so then it creates this problem so what we really have is something like a nested sovereignty or more complex understanding of these relationships about who is where I think the argument being made in the textbook here is that like the idea of these places as traditionally part of Mexico that were lost by territory boundary dispute or let's be clear in many cases settlers illegally settling and then the state being like I guess I guess that's ours now right like that's why British Columbia has this problem of unseated territory because it's like it was settled but it's not necessarily legal per se and so southern states are inherently in between they have these foreign legacies of culture they're desperate to establish an identity and they're constantly refounding this identity this overcompensation that's what I think like you know there are absolutely border disputes all throughout Europe but there's also European identity right I don't know what a North American identity is I I know the dominant settler identity is something akin to sports and beer maybe and flag waving I guess but in practice the culture there doesn't have a deep and established tradition that we would call ethnicity right um there is no singular Canadian identity um you can try they desperately want to create an American identity but their fear their constant fear about like the loss of their property back to lock has to do with the ways in which that citizenship is bound up and they know full well that they're settled on that territory and how dare you have the right to do anything so I saw you know who knows I saw meme online or whatever but and this real increasing thing that in the States you don't ring doorbells anymore because people now are so fearful of something coming to take their property that they're willing to shoot first when you ring a doorbell which is an overcompensation for a lack of culture that feels secure in its cultural identity it doesn't have to care so much about being invaded right um and so in the classic political thought then foreignness generally is is taken to signify the threat of corruption it must be kept out or contained for the sake of the stability of the regime and so all of our development of of foreignness or protections against foreignness or about the proper level of migration has to do with I mean I don't know but we have a long history of um uh Chinese population Chinese speakers in Canada um my sister-in-law it has um my niece she's speaking uh Cantonese um we have this tradition so why not just you know let a greater number of Chinese population gets citizenship as Canadians and you'll see immediately how much well it's disruptive to whatever because it's not like ours or whatever I mean there was all sorts of this stuff when um the money first got out in China and the Chinese population which has basically been a feudal population all of a sudden was middle class and started traveling all over the world you see signs up in India in New York about like what's proper behavior because they'd never encountered the rest of the world they went from from not having this experience of a passport and the ability to travel to fully traveling and that it creates all of these culture clashes about you know what are you supposed to do they've got all these signs you know at buffets right like westerners don't waste your food at a buffet right like you're just wasting food for no reason these types of attitudes and opinions result in culture clashes so one of the problems of course is that we know that the West has and this is across the board declining birth rates these are the 2021 uh it's too small to see here but like almost every country including some other ones have declining birth rates this is the other problem is that we are aging rapidly so this is just Europe but you can see how quickly the ages are shooting up it's even worse in places like Korea and Japan so for example in Korea and there will be uh nine seniors for every 10 working um in a place like South Africa there are 10 working for every two elderly or seniors so we have problems of providing those social goods and we have this situation where we have more and more migrants without citizenship so Qatar is number two on there the UAE is number one so we have solutions to these problems and just nobody wants to deal with them because they have to deal with the foreignness problem is that we have these these migrants you know 272 million migrants migrants doesn't confer citizenship it just talks about movement right so you can work there you can have a status it don't necessarily have full citizenship um and that is and again there's three percent we have eight billion people on the planet that's not very much Mobility right um and so we have this idea of migration or migration that happens in ways we don't like so there are flows that we're not expecting or there's more of it but we also know that migration would fix these problems we have in our systems it's just nobody's willing to do the math even though everybody's doing the math right we don't have enough people who here are young to pay for these Social Security Programs for an increasingly uh older population as they get older we all age we are going to need more young people there are lots of young people all throughout the world in situations that if we were granting them status they could help each other mutually because in the growth economy we have no set boundary on how big economies can get we just don't want to have those questions because of the ways that we think about citizenship the idea that um the the destinations um are not really here as much anymore because of the the ranking and those all of those things um that we have these populations that are moving because they don't have access to those resources in those other economies um and then we have this perception that it creates new problems because the opinions and ideas that come with those people aren't ones that we think that we have here right now and so we've seen this idea that there's certain places that have higher amounts of migration and certain places that have less but they're certainly not at levels to sustain the Western um population declines right um and so whatever we have this global migration it's increased politicization and forced debates on management regulation of borders it's sure countries are selectively opening and closing borders based on groups and there's Vickers and Isaac states make race um desirability of the migrant it's kind of gross right like this Global race for talent will do it in both ways um states make race and they have Longley the what Vickers and I argue is that the the long history of North American and particularly settlerless Society so Australia and uh New Zealand Australia New Zealand Canada and the US have wanted to maintain like an 80 white population explicitly framed in terms of race right um and that they don't like upsetting that number because it seems to be politically unstable because um when you have privilege equality seems like oppression I don't know what to tell you that um and so this idea then of of work experience language ability and education is the West selectively brain draining these other countries but not at a rate of speed that's making substantive inroads against the loss of population growth and the age problem and so we can see this right so that we have all of these these people coming to to to immigrate here um but the permanent and non-permanent immigration is 80 of our population growth right so the only reason that we're growing is because of migration and yet we make it difficult or we use things like temporary work permits or this idea of establishing permanent residence or refugees still a tiny number there and that this but it becomes this point of moral Panic we have whole political parties that create their entire campaigns around the threats of migration framing these issues okay I'll stop there in case because otherwise I'll go on for 30 minutes again but that's just this idea of of thinking about the ways in which we should be dealing with these this foreignness issue but we we can't because of the ways that we feel about this you don't want to suddenly be uh I was going to say you don't want to be the only one in your community that's not speaking Mandarin so therefore you won't open your borders to a population that could fully fill up our social safety networks I I don't know what else to tell you I wish we could we could frame it some other way anyways I'll stop there
 so I assume this will have to be a Dropbox video because we're going to get a copyright strike for this but um this is the textbook video It's actually kind of interesting what do we know what's happening right now there's been some condemnation including from the Arab League president erdogan seems to be pushing back right it's uh really the second full day of uh of turkey's incursion into Northern Syria and uh it's that's really generated International condemnation of the move and there's even a closed-door U.N security Council meeting going on about that about that incursion right now president erdogan has pushed back very strongly he said uh in a basically a threat to Europe that if uh if the criticism doesn't tone down he's willing to open the floodgates he says to millions of Syrian refugees who have resettled in Turkey saying he'll push them into Europe and uh as you remember when that last happened at the at the early days so this is the way in which borders and migration then become kind of tools or weapons of statecraft so States use bodies as threats this is by no means new we have now generations of Palestinians throughout the region who have lived their entire lives and their parents have lived their entire lives outside of the place of which they're supposed to have citizenship right because it's not a state and so I I haven't got to yet at some point we'll get to Israel Palestine but um yeah I'll use it as an example at some point but the interesting part here is is not about the ways in which we can get into that that whole the interesting part is the surrounding regions are using Palestinians Refugee status as an ongoing form of weaponization against Israel and there's a bunch of studies on this as a source of revenue for them so places like Jordan have a huge Palestinian population they could have just converted them into jordanians and allowed them to have dual status but it makes more sense to have this sense of outrage that then fuels money that goes to those communities to support them so you don't have to so there is this strategic weaponization of bodies that belong or don't belong against other states as strategies of like State craft and warfare so we'll get to this next week when we start dealing with international relations but I'll let them finish days of the Syrian Civil War that resulted in big political uh earthquake across the continent uh undermined Chancellor merkel's government it shook up politics in the UK so erdogan is trying to use uh whatever leverage he has to remember it was the securitization of the idea of the influx of migrants that led the bus going around just with fake news going around claiming that that um the EU is going to force the Brits to take on more migrants was one of the reasons they went with brexit so it's a strategic weapon this is also I don't like getting into it too much because you get into these weird kind of gross using of people for political ends push back on what's been a widely condemned move into Syria so as you suggest that threat from president erdogan struck me at least as a potential Doomsday Machine for Europe if they really released millions of refugees into Europe is there anything Doomsday Machine people effectively constraining president erdogan right now president Trump says he could wreck his economy if he went too far I think it's more Bluster and uh than reality uh in terms of what this threat is President Trump has repeatedly said he has a lot of sanctions levers at his disposal and remember turkey is still a NATO member it still craves the uh still craves that uh role so this is super complicated too because the Kurds are one of those groups that just never got statehood um and given that we have States now and they're not reproductive they don't see any way to give statehood to groups without giving up their statehood so this is the problem of secession movements and this idea that Kurds and Kurdistan is this political project that undermines and threatens the National Security in their mind of turkey has as the second biggest military in NATO and obviously angering most of your European Partners is not the way to to remain in that kind of Alliance so I think he's frustrated with uh with the criticism his move is generated but I don't think we're close to seeing refugees pushed into Europe at this point what do we know what's happening so it's just this kind of the ways in which states political politicized and and weaponize um these issues I will see how it goes um in terms of this course in general this this question should non-citizens who live in Canada such as migrant workers and international students be granted all the same rights Canadian Nationals where why not uh I I'm not super comfortable with that I mean you I mean we can do what we want it's just it the question is framed in such a way as like do you or do you have your human rights or not because you're not from here you don't uh can you imagine the idea of being able to say I'm from here so therefore I get to decide whether or not you are a human at equal human in terms of Rights and responsibilities right I guess that's what we do it just when you frame it differently it becomes very weird how comfortable we are making such claims and how immediately we are well yeah because we have to because we can't just have the radical social change that comes from set all their societies can't have the radical social change that they know comes from settlement of a mass population that pushes out the previously existing population oh man okay I gotta end it there because I can't do better than that
 okay uh Welcome to our discussion on citizenship and borders um this is an interesting topic I always said that if I was going to redo my degree in political science I'd probably do migration studies or citizenship studies because it's so kind of integral to how we understand the very basic notion of the political and this goes back to what we've been talking about throughout the course of this Aristotelian and this notion coming from Greek and and um uh Athenian experience about who is a citizen and who who has rights and who is political and known and so it goes to the very question of what is political is dealing with citizenship and borders so this week we're going to deal with these Concepts and so we use these Concepts so much to kind of ingrained in us so it's hard for us to think them I'm going to try to avoid as much of the um kind of partisan emotional stuff around these issues because it's so heavily coded in ways of thinking about who we are and who we should be and all these identity issues and this is why it falls in the identity week but it also kind of problematizes those identities um for me what I was really surprised is that my fourth year students last year a couple of them wanted to deal with migration and their their Capstone project so we did a week on migration I went and found a couple books up-to-date books like an Oxford handbook on it and you know up-to-date books on these things um and I was surprised how critical they were citizenship studies in particular has moved very critically in ways that I don't think most people would be even aware of of how far they've moved and I was I was shocked myself so they're very it's very interesting but it rubs up against our sense of oh well that's the way we do things so we'll talk about um this relationship between citizenship and borders the origins of citizenship and and thinking about what it means and doesn't mean the rights associated with citizenship explain what formal citizenship is a bit talk about borders and borders will lead into the discussion for the next week when we start dealing with international relations so so we've dealt with ideas identity and then we're going to the international which I think is very into how this stuff has been structured right we always deal with these kind of local individual issues and then go right to the the UN or human rights issues or whatever we go to the top level we miss all the stuff that you're going to do in the second and the next term um it's it's this way in which we kind of divide up the discussion of the political um and then we'll talk about citizenship in a little bit when it comes to to covid um so I will say this [Music] um border issue is bigger than partisan issues and it generally involves claims and thinking that we're all embedded in it also is one where I mean you will have very strong opinions that don't amount to much like this so we have Kamala Harris saying in 2018 Trump's border walls absolute waste of taxpayer money I will not support it um Joe Biden says a border wall is physical embodiment of the inability to develop effective immigration policy and then the bite Administration gets elected and they continue to fund the border wall um this was very similar to um the problems of borders and how specific governments can't affect things that have to do with the state itself um so my example would always be Obama one of the first things he did when he got elected was sign a bill saying he was closing Guantanamo Bay Guantanamo Bay is still open to this day and so the idea then that just because you're in power you can change like the makeup of these things it's not very likely so it's more about ways in which you frame the issue or frame how these things work um so the textbook starts with a bunch of premises that I'm not entirely sure why um covid-19 pandemic was not the great equalizer predicted by The Who so I wrote a chapter on this and I went back and looked even back to Ebola and all the rest of it there were people yelling loud and clear the whole time um this liberal notion that somehow everybody is going to see a concept as objective and not contest it and politicize it and think about it and challenge it I don't know why we would ever think that it would be naively rational for people to just take radical change and and treat it as as uncontestable um so at best like I I did not think we would get a whole lot of it I thought maybe we get some Better Health Care maybe um especially Americans right you thought there would be some impetus for it but at certain points they were no like they wouldn't even you know do basic things that look too socialist so whatever um Health social and economic and political impacts of the pandemic were not experienced by everyone in the same way why would it be is it because it's seen as objective but like isn't everything experienced differently by different people if you've got access to resources things are going to be very different than if you don't right if you can sit in your your yacht off the coast um well all the stuff happens within the country you're going to experience things very differently it's always experienced differently um so this idea of you know closing the Border travel bans and debates on essential and non-essential workers so on one level yes the Border was closed for the public but I mean I couldn't find the data here but anyway I've seen it um basically like government relationships and high level politics and Elite politics still happened even when things were at the most closed um there were still exemptions for for government officers who need to be like top secret you know you're gonna still do intelligence still going to do those things um and so this idea then that that somehow um things weren't experienced hierarchically and are always doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's fine it's a naively optimistic claim I guess that somehow like that objective characteristics wouldn't would be objective um and I would also say that our framing of things like essential and non-essential workers is very loaded right so we know that yes absolutely um you know healthcare workers were at the front of it but we also know that like the teenagers working at the grocery store were at the front of it too they just weren't they were Frank as essential but not in a way that was really as such that we did clap for them as much I guess we did later but at the outset and um you know construction workers right and if you actually look at the number of people who were at work from home it was largely just you know that the the upper middle class who didn't have to like physically work in a physical space so my wife is a Horse Ride instructor she was alone she couldn't have anybody in but she was working the whole time you can't leave horses right like they would die right like you have to do that so there's always going to be workers working the problem is is that most of the people who write about these things think about these things and discuss these things are from a group that talk about everything their own experience as if it's a universe experience right and so the idea here is that it would prompt some discussion or conversations about citizenship and borders um but you know whether or not that's actually going to happen or how much it would happen would be up to um specific circumstances so there's been this long-standing discussion especially in Canada U.S is that for example when you buy something from the states when it comes across the border you might get hit with a Duty or some type of taxes or extra money that would count towards it and that is actually negotiated by the Canadian government because the Americans are like hey if we can sell more stuff to Canadians we'll absolutely just ship it across the border like get rid of that like let us dump in as much as we want I mean the Canadians like well no we have to protect Canadian businesses and by doing that we're actually charging Canadian consumers more so we're looking after the interests of Canadian businesses by making Canadians pay more through the Border like literally by putting the de minimis the amount that you can send without having to hit a Duty or fee as they want it as relatively low as possible where the Americans wanted as high as possible so one of the arguments has been is that if we actually want to have a beneficial trade relationship or a beneficial relationship is that why not give this goes along there was proposals to create a North American monetary Union like the EU and one of the things you do would create a common border like the EU like the Shenzhen Zone they have in Europe which would just be you have a perimeter security that the Americans police are on the outside and then you get free access to the Americans you can go over as much as day trips all the rest of it they they do the outside border you do the internal border and sort of function like the EU so the premise of course is that certain types of cooperation would be beneficial in borders in the way of that cooperation the problem of course is that what happened in the EU when we had the Syrian refugee crisis is that internal borders started popping up again is that we can always move back towards the idea that we should keep people out for whatever reason and then that would be how we would do it and so this idea somehow that that the great equalizer is a naive position based on a kind of lack of understanding of basic political precepts that people are going to contest any decision so thinking about citizenship and borders that is thinking about the ways in which we can it's all bound up in one another I'll talk about um the go specifically into citizenship in the next video
 so if we jettison the idea that there is something fundamentally new about the ways in which these questions come to us then we can kind of start to unpack some of the assumptions that are built into how we think about digital Technologies and democracy certainly it matters I I don't know if I agree with this assertion we've always had this I mean the the myth of a mass media has largely been that people get their data all from one sources I don't know that that's the case there have always been rumors conspiracy theories Whispers gossip those type of things they they matter right as we've talked about before and as a consequence of that then maybe McLaren's medium is the message is the point of like something like the CBC for example isn't that the content on the CBC means anything it's that we are accessing the CBC as a free or as a publicly subsidized um National infrastructure so what the CBC does is actually create Canadians it's not about what's on on the thing it's the platform that matters that not the content so I mean we've always had these things like we've had radio ham radio those types of stuff and yellow journalism there's always been salacious gossip magazines The National Enquirer things like that that have always been around who develop counter narratives to dominant narratives right um they're all mediated right everything's media we're mediated by the the news we get whether it's radio I mean long history and the evangelicals have had this the the it's called the jeremiahad the fall of civilization predates the Americans there was a Canadian who used to go on the radio back in the day and say that America's Society is falling and this was a way for him to get money but also to make people very suspicious of this new American state so there's no new um nothing new about this per se little opportunity for citizens to communicate with politicians or the media and Fireside Chats were like the first propaganda when like FDR would sit on the radio and tell everybody about what was up to date so the idea of rhetoric or that people aren't passively producing information it just it I don't see any foundation for it I can't do all of his he has got a whole bunch of great videos um uh but he's talking specifically here about this idea of um of he's being accused of disinformation talking about the uh just this notion of uh slavery and the idea that people their own leaders uh were the ones who sold them into slavery as if there wasn't like active theft of people involved in the slave trade hey good morning you said not one person was stolen they were sold by their own leaders don't race bait if you're going to use this information well Brock Childers 87 I can clearly see that you're Alabaster Alabama education has failed you so come here real quick so this is a key aspect here it's we want to say that like somehow information on the Internet is going to be you know anybody can post it and so you don't know who it is but like racism and the ability to perceive and and make claims on each other about whose disinformation or misinformation it's not new right like this is not new this is a long history of this and so this idea that somehow the internet is a place where we didn't have back and forth so that we didn't have letters to the editor we didn't have you know organizations like the KKK being able to propagate their ideas we didn't have remember the KKK all the secret hand codes and everything were taken down by the radio because um uh it was in the Superman series the radio series that somebody infiltrated the KKK um I think it was a I think it was a Jewish activist infiltrated the KK got all their hand signals then went on the Superman radio show and told everybody about them so we could all spot KKK members so like this has always been there I just I don't believe this notion kind of kind of passive technology let's have a conversation first and foremost I'm gonna need you to stop lying you are far too old for that stop it secondly the lies you're telling were started by a racist Cloister of Cairns known as the United Daughters of Confederacy their job was to spread myths and disinformation about slavery in the United States of America they lied and rewrote history books making sure that they favored the South and protected racists you racists and many disinformed people say that nobody was stolen from Africa while history says this sir Admiral John so before we get into that I just want to make a comment on on this idea of dis and misinformation these claims we'll come back to it I talked about a bit before the idea of an epistemic bubble also happens so this can happen academically it can happen in academic disciplines it can happen across information it can happen online it can happen in your friend group the idea of information being politically contested being political is inherent to information and so this idea that technology would somehow and allow us to do something with that be more accurate less accurate he's talking about something that happened 100 years ago that we're still fighting about today so information is still always transmitted I don't know if you're going to be able to see this text but he's got sources is the main Hawkins hijacked a Portuguese slave ship and sold 300 Africans from it and on his second trip he captured 400 Africans he didn't buy them he didn't purchase them and he didn't trade for them he captured them so he's just providing evidence for the claim and we'll come back to this again about this idea of it's It's the acronym is crap about how to find good information versus bad information right and and and all the controversy around that it's not controversy contestation around that is a better word okay let me he I'm going to give him a bit more space to to make his arguments here and when he finished he wrote a book titled an alliance to raid for slaves and in this book he tells the story of the very first Africans they captured kidnapped and stole he writes in his book I went myself where we took 250 persons men women and children he said nothing about buying them not purchasing them not trading them he said we took 250 people and in total there were 600 prisoners and yet here you are just loud proud and wrong declaring that nobody was stolen you then go on to say that they were sold by their own leaders and that too is false Africa has the highest form of genetic diversity on the planet before white people showed up there was no we are all Africans we are all black no they were different ethnicities much like you Europeans were how you British were different from the okay we already covered that in the race stuff hey I'm going to go on just because I don't want to get too dragged down into that argument I mean the point is is that race is online race and Technology are integrated and and forms of racism and I'll talk about this later are everywhere um and so yes digital technology or interactive labs for multi-directional flow of political information so the idea here is that like the past was somehow passive about information and the present is somehow different I don't know that that that statement can hold it's it's a broad claim that doesn't have a ton of foundation in the text so the idea here is that citizens are active participants and producers of political information so we'll get into this but again this is a Chinese run platform that Americans are fighting about race on we can't lose that part of it either right um and so racism sexism misogyny teen depression self-harm etc those are all kind of consequences of society going online and and major maybe amplifying or reinforcing patterns that were already there so we have this notion of cyber optimism that sees um technology as positive and empowering for citizens okay I I don't love to use the the term here because as we talked about in the migration anyways uh gives voices to marginalized communities sure uh liberation theology is an authoritarian regimes maybe uh privity privacy security and over from oversight intrusion maybe I mean maybe if these systems are secure you could provide data like you could whistleblow right and so we we've seen that for example with a Snowden or uh Wikileaks right the idea that the technology allows us to to do new things I guess um but we have we also have their like basic principles right it's basic ideas about we could see this as positive that that this idea of Technology can reinforce for us the idea that you know we should have privacy and that we should build it into our technology that we should make sure that we are visible transparent have you know the capability to see things have security complete and privacy by default um and treat our our data as as um as a a thing that we should be concerned with but unfortunately that's probably not the case um there is some really interesting stuff coming from the fact that we just bleed data all over the place that our devices are constantly sending data out to other systems and remember the cloud is just somebody else's computer um and this book in particular focuses on the politics and and the ways in which it cuts both ways so what's really interesting about this is that this goes after Google searches as a way to tell us what people actually believe because people will say stuff all sorts of stuff you've seen this over and over you can look at Trends in I'm not going to get into it it gets pretty crass but for example in states that are tend to be very um religiously oppressive they tend to have very interesting search results when it comes to stuff they want to look at whereas it's it's less so in places that are more open and the idea here is that um what you your search history he tells you is like if you you know if you were going on Ashley Madison back in the day looking to actively have an affair clearly that data is important in all sorts of political ways and then when it's inevitably leaked which I'll talk about in a minute it raises all sorts of questions about what do we do with this data that's that's now out there right um on top of that states have have actively done this so one of the things that came out of the um the Snowden leaks um was the idea that that Canada as a Ally and partner of the five eyes Network Canada US Australia and New Zealand um and the UK they have since World War II cooperated on security and intelligence matters but one of those things that they they got and this was in the the Global Mail was that um as part of that Arrangement when Canada enters into trade talks with Brazil for example um they were having they had access sitting at the table negotiating with them with everything that was happening on the other side's phones they basically had hacked in or had access through this back-end database stuff to get access to all of the text messages going on at the trade negotiators on the other side so Canada and Brazil think they're sitting down as political equals but this technology then amplifies their capacity to to make these claims now this technology gets exposed and then um Brazil is like wait a minute we're not going to talk to you anymore and so it absolutely has all sorts of political ramifications and so cyber pessimism is seeing these digital Technologies as harmful and generating extremism um of authoritarian regimes China can actively I've got an example Here China can actively have different sets of standards for its own citizens and for what it platforms elsewhere it tends to organize and amplify extreme voices Echo chamber and epistemic Bubbles I'll talk about all of those the extreme voices is because advertising because these I mean BJ Fogg he had the center back in the day at MIT and they taught all of the the people went on to Silicon Valley about psychology social psychology how to maximize things like red notification icons to maximize things that that trigger in US emotional responses so that we will continue to engage more and more with the content right the the quick speed access to give us those dopamine hits in order to do this Tristan Harris has tons of stuff on this um and then the idea that the private sector is beyond government control and so cyber pessimism is that Facebook is interested in profit it's amoral and as a consequence of that it's going to platform whatever gives it the most money including election misinformation disinformation whatever and will say that it tries to control this stuff but probably won't unless the government mandates that they do so and we've got enough evidence now that that's the case and so it becomes data and data out the internet is dominated by white Western men in training data ethos and attitudes and this is called the Silicon Valley neophilia I've got lots of examples of this the most famous one is this this is Mark Zuckerberg saying that this was kind of the ethos of what they were doing including like like democracy they can move fast and break those things um the idea of the internet is providing Global benefit versus things like this so Global research.c I saw it in my student papers a couple years ago and I was like what is this thing it's straight dis and misinformation and it's platformed on dot CA the Canadian domain which is run by icann which is digital registrar in Canada that is monitored and controlled but at least in some extent by government regulation but it's hosted on our so I don't know whether or not Canada should take a more active role when it we don't like to do it we don't we like the idea of free speech so we don't want to get in the precedent of shutting down websites we don't like but I mean I'm I I understand the idea that it causes a problem we also have the ways in which doxing are releasing a personal information online poses all sorts of threats to people and everybody else I used to be able to pull up in class docspent um the docsman archive for a while was just sitting out there on the internet and it would have like Hillary Clinton's social security number it had Taylor Swift's phone number like all sorts of information on there that poses all sorts of privacy and security uh problems but this is the problem with these websites ashleymadison.com thing I downloaded all the data it's still on the Pirate Bay I think you can get it it's like six or eight gigabytes of data um and just went through through it looked at all the um University email addresses that were in it lots of people use their University email addresses to do this you could also go by your townships and see for example like York Region email addresses and find out who was on that website oh by the way that website for cheating was largely run uh it was like 90 male the employees were pretending to be women and the Bots were the primary people that were interacting with so there were there was almost no women on the site so they're all trying to get into relationships with Bots I don't know what that means either so all of this is to say is that this information creates these two sides of problems when we're thinking about politics and security um this idea that anybody can do anything on the internet which they're more in increases all of our vulnerability we still never know who hacked Ashley Madison why they did it um disgruntled employee is one of the the biggest Frameworks and then we have on the other side the idea that this costs or that so much 85 percent of the infrastructure for the internet is in private hands so governments want to regulate the internet but the bulk of it is in private hands which is also for them they do the guns and butter calculation for their shareholders the state does it for their citizens private companies do it for their shareholders and so they don't necessarily want to fix these things and so thinking about where this leads us is to What's called the in the kind of current moment this idea of moving towards zero trust technology because in order to get some level of security we have to assume that everything is going to get leaked or hacked at some point just try to firewall everything right we constantly reassert your identity you constantly have to reevaluate systems you don't have this idea that in here it's secure and out there it's not and so there's no Insider outside I like this and that it challenges the idea of the like territorial boundaries of the Sovereign Nation State don't think that way but at the same time I don't know as a continuous process if we create security as a verb rather than a noun we we make everybody suspicious of everybody else and I would say that that's kind of what we've ended up with with this technology online is that I think that covet in particular taught us that one there's lots of things that could be accelerated we could work from home we can use zoom we don't need to get together we don't need to meet but also we need to get together we need to meet um the the mediated space of this is not the same as reality and it's always going to distort our perceptions of self and what we can do and what we should do and all of those things so thinking about it in those terms then I don't know if we can have social relations without trust and I don't know if we can have Trust online and so this idea of how we produce a positive social I want to be a cyber Optimist but I understand the Cyber pessimist argument because it it um it there was our strong Arguments for both
 so I keep talking about this Silicon Valley ethos and I've got some examples of of what that means in terms of of setting Loosely internet on our political systems so it kills monkey is a thought experiment and Netflix did it said Imagine You release a bunch of monkeys in your server room and it's not unplugging stuff is your infrastructure going to be resilient is it going to be able to keep up with monkeys and plugging random and so this book says that Tech is the chaos monkeys of society like huh so what happens if I allow anybody to rent a room in their place oh nobody in Barcelona can afford to buy an apartment anymore sounds like you problem not a me problem and it feels kind of the same like you know open and I'll be like you know I'm gonna just realize this I don't know how this is going to impact the world they actually said that let's just test it out in the meantime this is how we did it and then a bunch of other people release it and then suddenly you can release it as the fourth guy who released it so it's not your fault you were trying to be chill and then you know everybody else oh there's no concept art anymore oh all the famous artists are being copied yeah oh  etc etc so this idea of the ways in which we release Technologies and and listen they're well-intentioned engineering solutions to perceived problems the problem is is that they often don't have any incentive structures to deal with what are the um worst case uses of this technology and how will this technology in many cases like Zuckerberg said he wanted to move fast and break things but breaking things like voting doesn't seem like something you'd want to do so the idea of of having the internet for voting for plebiscites should be great it should allow for more turnout and accessible elections for improved uh voter turnout assuming that's what we want and so these security and privacy concerns I mean long been the argument that if you wanted to really do e-voting you just put it with your Banks because your banks are the ones who have the closest relationship to you a lot of banks are now almost entirely digital and they verify identity and they could do security and background a lot better because they have money um literal money and that they have to protect that money it's the one thing they want to do um and so designing systems that prevent manipulation of ballots well while protecting privacy yeah I mean I don't know if we trust the banks enough if they have an interest in a political outcome right so that idea of firewalling um so yeah we've got examples Estonia is this digitally connected place that we keep referring to because it's been so on the Forefront of this stuff um Municipal elections in Nova Scotia Ontario increasing uh voter turnout and then this idea of allowing indigenous Nations to have access to the internet so they can that people can um can vote can participate um and I mean in the last provincial election it's still a problem of just getting voting stations on reserves that this has been a persistent problem that we still see to this day um that were were chronically because of infrastructure and capacity resources um training all the rest of it getting these into the sites where they are but these are largely exceptions and not the norm uh so when we think about digitally enabled politics we really need to think about the ways in which Tech promises solutions to problems but then might not actually deliver it becomes what what first is a bug then becomes a feature or the claimed feature never moves past the bug stage so I've been good to to stay off picking on Elon this one I just can't help next year will probably be 90 capable of autopilot like so 90 of miles could be on auto you know for sure Highway uh travel we're probably only a month away from having a autonomous driving baseball highways and for relatively simple roads like a model S and model X at this point I can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person right now is self-driving will be will Encompass essentially all remote driving and the 100 to 200 percent safer than a person by the FX talking for maybe 18 months from now I feel very confident predicting I'm I'm extremely confident of achieving a full autonomy uh and releasing it to the Tesla customer base uh next year when do you think Tesla will solve Level 4 FSD [Music] I mean it's looking quite likely that it will be next year [Music] um so the idea here is that in a democratic system when you have private actors they're able to make claims and the question is who's going to hold them to account especially when we've got all these problems with media that we've talked about before um I would also say on that I mean the grumpy old Geeks have been arguing this it's a podcast um they've been arguing this for a decade the problem isn't self-driving cars it's people it's the other people on the road if if it was all self-driving cars that would be fine the problem is is that there's people on the road and all the self-driving still has problems with I mean famously when Uber was testing it um had a problem it couldn't identify if someone crossing the road was a biker or pedestrian biker pedestrian biker pedestrian and while it was trying to figure that out it ran over them so the idea here is that just because we have technology doesn't mean that the application that technology is always going to result in outcomes we want um you know they just had a report come out of that that the auto drive has I think it's killed 17 people in the last four years I don't know if that's more or less though than regular cars right but at least with the regular cars we feel like we can hold someone accountable it's harder when you just say oh my software went wrong or right I didn't design that properly right so all systems then especially open systems are open to manipulation an example of this would be the idea of Wikipedia so making things democratic can provide you with the ability of anybody to make claims we're just not sure if we want anybody making claims 77 percent of all Wikipedia articles are written by one percent of its editors I saw one the other day there's some guy goes around he's like corrected like 40 000 times like the they're an expression because he's Vigilant about this expression sure it's great that we're all doing this and that people can dedicate those times having one percent of people control 77 percent of the Articles though sounds a lot like editorial control rather than democracy right um vandalism is usually repair quickly most users never see the effects um you know political covered commentators argue that the the coverage is affected by liberal by assure if your sources are liberal or it's going to reproduce that um the real dangerous part is New York Times has reported that U.S courts have over 100 judicial rulings that have replied on relied on the encyclopedia including taxes narcotics civil issues personal injury matrimony they rely on Wikipedia people have already been one lawyer already got censured for using chat GPT that made up a bunch of cases and so the idea here is that this is that like the benefits of an open system an open system produces information that we can all edit and vet and so this is like open source software and open source intelligence they're they're better systems because you have more eyes on them the problem of course is is the epistemic problems right so if we all have a certain assumption that things work a certain way it doesn't matter what field we're in um we can take politics we still use 1648 as the foundation of of sovereignty and that sovereignty is the best way to explain the International System blah blah blah blah um or the system in which it works but then that has a whole bunch of tacit biases like it just erases the way in which settlement involves massive displacement and genocide um and so those questions then become epistemically pushed out we have Paradigm debates where like which approach is best and we'll talk about that next week and then academic disciplining them itself so many sub-disciplines sub-journals there's journals of whatever studies now you can have um you know gamification looking at video game studies you can do pornography studies you can do whatever you want there's there's studies of everything which specializes um information listen we've got more scientists alive today than have ever existed in human history it's just the number of people so you're going to have extreme specialization which means that it's going to be harder and harder to have generalists be able to talk about things across disciplines which then reproduces the likelihood of epistemic bias right of of you all agreeing on something because everybody in your narrow discipline does without thinking about what another discipline is saying about that um and so of course we have Echo Chambers on the internet and so that's reinforced that they these are all examples of democratic information reinforcing non-democratic ways of being which is all back to the liberal democracy discussion is that we kind of need to enforce liberal democracy we have to have people who are advocating for those liberal values they don't develop organically there is always Force threat of force use of violence in order to reinforce the ideas that we use so um we have this idea then that different social groupings have different ways of conceptualizing what the good is or what we should be doing and so you can have false information that gets through these open systems and so that's misinformation or the intentional information that is disinformation we can still have this discussion we'll have it in class as just what was the reason for the Iraq War it is one of those situations where there's so many things overlapping on each other everybody's result tells us more about which one of those they're coming from than it does about the actual events right and so things like election interference and voting in elections it's not new both the U.S and the USSR tried to routinely interfere in each other's political processes Radio free America Cold War incentives threats manipulations Flyers drop Flyers about how how terrible it is with your leader in charge get a new leader um I won't I don't have any time to get into the Haiti stuff but Canada us and France intervened and it resulted in a democratically elected leader being ousted and we've had in the last couple years the assassination of um of the Haitian president um by a miami-based um dentist I I don't even know the the data's so bad in order to destabilize I don't know we don't have a new uh leader in place and so we've got these ways in which countries interfere in one another I'll leave it at that there's a lot a lot to do there um we have former colonies uh UK France Netherlands Spain that continually um have interests and continue to show interest in the outcomes of Elections Spain specifically in Catalonia um secessionist movements right you want to try to destabilize those movements and let them not in the case of Spain literally not have a referendum on whether or not they want to leave um make it illegal and then um everybody wants to interfere with the US so Iran China the Soviet Union Vietnam um the Nazis Israel everybody wants to interfere um with those because it it affects their their those States directly right so there's a vested interest in engaging in that um and so we don't know if there is a way to prevent foreign election interference it is cheaper than it's ever been and it's more easy than it's ever been and I'll bring in some examples in a bit the problem and why it's cheaper is because we have these monopolistic platforms which means that everybody actually is in the same place and so this is um I just did you stats counter the the extent to which Facebook is dominant social media and Google is dominant in search that means that if you're searching these things having information on those platforms means that that's where people are going to get information also we have massive consolidation of of most media platforms uh down the bottom there is is Canada's Consolidated media platforms um you know in 1983 in the US you had many in 2011 you had uh six I think we're down to four three four and even in Europe um there's basically one two three four five six seven that have have basically control of all those other so it reproduces that problem we saw with the video earlier um and so the idea of having a monopolistic control of media does reinforce the ways in which Bad actors can spread their messages at scale and scope that they could have in otherwise couldn't have otherwise um and so while we want to have democracy it's not clear there's nothing about Athenian democracy specifically because it relates to citizenship and then who is a citizen and who is not what information the citizens are supposed to have and should the information be Democratic or should it reinforce the idea that citizens and those only citizens should have a say in the outcome and so this becomes the problem about operations abroad to interfere I don't know did Tick Tock could be one big massive social disruption campaign put on by China into the U.S only because it's not reflected back into China if it was reflected back into China if it was a it's not WeChat it's it's not a platform that goes back into the country in which it came from and so that by definition means that it's going to have more influence elsewhere than at home and so this idea of using things like Wikileaks to spread information um you know Assange famously is an anarchist so he wants to intentionally sabotage the nation-states of the world and that makes him a threat to those nation states and it's not clear that anybody's going to defend you if you're a threat to All Nation States um and so I mean Nate silver the kind of he's the the famous political scientist who you know predicted um Obama's elections and then didn't do such a great job with Trump but he did say that that the idea of Russian interference from the Cambridge analytica data is is insignificant he said you know social media memes from Russia seem to have more impact than this Scandal that we said Facebook is responsible for it's like well how do we do this and so what what this means then is that in terms of Elections cyberspace elevates actors that wouldn't otherwise be able to to do what they can do so for example a traditional military force the U.S spends as much as the rest of the world combined clearly has what we would call hard power it has the capacity to do things with weapons and force in terms of soft power this is values and ideas the U.S has certainly declined in that that realm right it holding itself up as an example for the rest of the world has not been the last several I mean this goes back a while right um back to the Bush Administration of defunding or actively working against the United Nations it degrades the perception of the US and the eyes of others and so what happens then is that those others and this goes to what we'll talk about next week with Barrel power balancing um that cyber actors can magnify what what Joseph Nya Jr calls sharp power sharp power is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of another so you can do this through elections but you can do this by causing social unrest fomenting social unrest I've got some screen caps of um uh um stuff relating to uh Colin Kaepernick and the kneeling and the uh geolocation they forgot to turn off so it was they clearly says Russian actors are getting involved in supporting or antagonizing about um things like the Kaepernick um in the NFL the kneeling um as a responsive black lives matter we'll talk about it in a bit and so you don't actually need military force or moral persuasion you don't need hard or soft power if you can just interfere in others elections so you can use these regimes without fear of backlash and it gives um these this kind of asymmetry what's been called the Splinter net so um the open internet is is one form the closed internet um of uh China and a heavily regulated internet is another form and then the Russian internet which is actively interfering everywhere else and it's a clear crypto scams and theft and and crime all stemming from the ways in which that space is regulated means that the open system is more vulnerable than either of the other two and so this is the problem with cyber infrastructure is that 85 percent is in private hands and so states have to try to deal with a system that they don't entirely control so here's a discussion of the splinternet well well Andy was basically telling me was that everybody has to pitch in when it comes to cyber security Now what happens if the ongoing trade tensions lead to two internets three different internet sets of regulations and firms unable to cooperate cross-border I've been talking about the concept of three internets for a period of time now it's it's growing more defined more distinct that as regulatory environments split in their requirements and the Norms that they're trying to preserve that we're going to see a Chinese a European and a U.S and the rest of the world internet and what we're seeing over time is that that tension is not just developing between the United States and with China it's developing in those three Internets the recent French cyber security strategy didn't bother to put out an English translation and that tells us something about how the world is splitting up the regulatory burden of trying to ensure both I've heard Russia as the third one but EU makes sense too because it's the gdpr it has its own privacy regulations and a heavily regulated internet internet um and so the the danger of course is that we have different models we don't know about things like Tick Tock or businesses make money off of tick tock because they can advertise there it's a huge massive thing okay fine this is what um zuboff has called this kind of cycle of this technology on the internet what happens over and over again is the release of Technology um uh people get used to using the technology we all are on the I'm lecturing with the technology um and then we realize oh maybe we should have regulated this thing and so they might make some changes or not um but in the end they'll try to make you oh worry about that thing instead so we've been through multiple phases of this at this time uh all the cryptocurrency Bitcoin stuff we've been through this with web3 we're now going through it with AI or large language models every time we get somebody releasing a technology and the question is do we think that all those these systems are going to use them the same like a Chinese system that's already involved in regulating its populace now can automate that the European system can put in it already has heavy protections on overview and regulation of of AI and large language models and the Americans are like here you go just throw this stuff out there and see what happens so it's just this weird system why where we get this this idea of the experience then it also produces these very different experiences that you want to use a technology because it's new and interesting but over time it just degrades in its quality as it becomes more commercial or more regulated the easiest example is the um the cookies right so what was happening with cookies is that you were constantly being tracked and monitored and so finally they regulated them and said well you have to let people know they're being tracked and monitored so now on every stupid website we have to hit OK I accept cookies it's it's fundamentally useless it's a legal regulation that has taken something that was a problem and now has just made you constantly not even think about the problem and just click ok as if that that regulation produced a better outcome and so the problem is is that as these Technologies develop and emerge they become more and more habituated in the context in which they are and then reflect those values and interests so you know you'll have a platform that you just simply don't use anymore it's unusable because it doesn't do those things or the platform decides for let's do the case of Reddit we want to have um we've been around forever we've got a big user base all of these large language models are training off of Reddit data and red is not making any money so they're like well we're going to clamp down and we're going to make everybody use the official Reddit app which as I mentioned sucks um and in doing that they alienate and their entire user base and cause them to to get upset um but you understand they're a business they're trying to make money and so this is what's called The incidentification Thesis I don't like to use this guy too much because there's another Prof and then we're just kind of like echoing each other but you know this is fine and it comes from just a popular concept it's taking what zubov calls and she in her surveillance capitalism book talks about this dispossession cycle this way in which it takes your information and then increasingly the state and the business uses it against you um because kind of shittier what is the initiative insidification is a concept that was coined by the journalist and writer Cordy doctor back at the beginning and as you might have guessed from the word itself it describes the process by which websites platforms become shittier now his doctor describes it insidification is a three-step process Stage One locking the end users stage two lock in the business user stage three exploit them for instance doctor describes Amazon locked in young parents by selling Diapers at below cost lock them into such an extent that it destroyed divers.com after which Amazon could jack the price up past whatdiapers.com had been offering and it applies to social media too whether it's tick tock's Creator fund which is never grown in size or new incentives to create videos that are too long to be monetized on their competitor's plan I think Canada still doesn't have a Creator fund does it I I think we've been Ricky's walking we're behind the line where you piss people off but not so much that they leave so what's your favorite example of in shape what I don't care about that so this is just the idea that um we have to understand the political and social context in which social media is deployed and it's not uniform and it's always going to have these forms of resistance and the resistance doesn't have to be from below it can be from above too we would like more regulation I believe we need to age Gate apps right we've got enough data now that the harm and wellness of especially teenage girls on a lot of these apps um needs to have some type of of age gating on them so that we can at least say that if if we know the harms there we know who is subject there maybe not Target them with the same ads or distinguish but there just is no effort to regulate that and there's no effort to do that even though we know there's harm being caused
 why digital technology matters okay I guess um yeah here's some here I'll start getting into some of these these kind of short biting criticisms and we'll get into this is so messed up listen to how Tick Tock is different for kids in China versus kids in the United States in their version of tick tock if you're under 14 years old they show you science experiments you can do at home Museum exhibits patriotism videos and educational videos and they also limit it to only 40 minutes per day now they don't ship that version of tick tock to the rest of the world so it's almost like they recognize that technology is influencing kids development and they make their domestic version a spinach version of tick tock while they ship the Opium version to the rest of the world this is I think that was Tristan Harris there um so having these digitally enabled politics means that we've got some taciting explicit I mean this is cyber optimism cyber pessimism but it requires a level of government control I don't know how much we're comfortable with that government control can look like this as well do you this thing Pantry item this this those are pretty bad honey Tick Tock hates the H word h-o-n-e-y I was making history videos and I made one about the history of um and since then I've been a semi-shadow band because for some reason Tick Tock hates that word and people in my comments have been like that same thing happened to me uh that's because um there's a whole bunch John Oliver's and I've done is uh she is um president XI in China has persistently been mocked as being a Winnie the Pooh or Pooh Bear and then as a consequence then these systems are developed in order to to make sure that ideas that are critical of the Chinese government don't get platformed as much or maybe not I don't think it's as simple as a one-to-one really relationship but we absolutely know things like Tiananmen and that even like things like me too when they emerge over and over again in these networks if you control the networks you can make them go away if it's an open network Charter and so this idea of thinking about digitally enabled politics then we we've largely framed it in terms of the western experience in terms of digital government campaign and voting there's nothing wrong with framing it like that but we have to think about the ways in which um government capacity is kind of built into these things um the idea of enhanced Services um famously Australia has went to a digital uh driver's license and that digital driver's license has a massive security vulnerability that basically lets anybody Photoshop their age into it and it's been a persistent problem um so you would want to the the idea is is that providing access to the internet because it is a human right now is is the special reporter but there's a special reporter on on human rights and internet access because so much of what we do is online and so you would think that this would be better like Estonia and this idea of like having an Estonian digital citizenship anybody can be Estonian citizens or participate in that economy would be great um paying things or participating in this stuff online but but we saw that even in Ontario they had a system that you could renew your driver's license at a kiosk in malls and had to rip them all out and shut them all down because there was just rampant fraud right and so all of these Notions about how we think about this participation and how we do it the early kind of vision of the internet internet 1.0 as well here we'll put up a poll and people will vote on it and then we'll get the outcomes but then you get the polls being dictated by people who say horrible things and because it's hilarious it's boaty mcboatface or whatever but you know you can do all sorts of monstrous stuff here too and so um you know digital technology is not fundamentally alter government but it's this question of certainly they've had to respond but they always respond to New Media right the fireside chat is a form of responding to New Media famously like the interwar um uh Canadian Prime Ministers were horrible in terms of their like Charisma but they were effective leaders so they didn't but they didn't need those skills right and so I don't know if I I think that one of the dangers of moving towards a political system that we have where media is so integral to elections is that we are now voting more on a on the perception of the candidate than actually listening to the candidate but then again I don't know what debates have ever done right they reinforce and so you you would like to use digital Technologies to inform persuade and mobilize voters during election campaigns you know you know Obama and Trump um both using Twitter as kind of platform strategies um but the idea here is that you know Communications political strategy messaging hasn't changed all that much gaffes are still the same going viral there's nothing new about going viral we've always had moments that like how we're Dean's Yeehaw or whatever got him kicked out of the the possibility of being president right what is seen as non-presidential right um Biden fall over on a bike and it's fine um and so you know it's all of these Notions about uh how we deal with this and so voters are feel like they're part of the campaign but like honestly in a two-party system like in the U.S who cares what people feel like you understand the oligarchy argument coming in here um so one of the things that happens then on this I'll just jump right into it uh is is the danger of these systems now they've always been this way um I guess we just haven't been as cognizant of them or without the two-way communication we weren't able to to do these things and and um this I don't know that the liberal media has ever been any different than it is like the the grand old lady the New York Times has set the agenda for like U.S war making for a century I don't know that that's changed but this ability to call it out I think probably has changed and so that might be new um but what it's calling out is yeah I mean this dystopian nightmare of Technology Tony who's Jessica Headley and I'm Ryan Wolfe our greatest responsibility is to serve our Treasure Valley communities the El Paso Las Cruces communities Eastern Iowa communities Mid Michigan communities we are extremely proud of the quality balanced journalism that cbs4 news produces but in the country plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media more alarming some media Outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first the sharing of biased false news checking cash and this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is Extreme dangerous to our democracy extremely dangerous dangerous to our democracy microsocracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy uh good times so yeah I don't know I don't have any good um basis upon which I can say um consensus building has always been the purpose of policy um either responding to or or reacting to so the idea that we produce information over and over again I participated I was on the Cambridge analytical website I gave them access to my Facebook profile because my academic Facebook profile is literally academic you can just add me on there it doesn't matter I don't do Facebook otherwise um and I've largely deleted all my Twitter accounts now too there's just and I have like I think eight different Tick Tock profiles um so anyways the idea here is that um we reproduce information over and over again and then that makes reality um so I don't know the metaness of that is that is it fake news or is the message actually fine because we're all in agreement that what they're saying is true being forced to I'll say it's I'm seems dystopian but I don't know if that dystopian-ness is in there all I will say you don't need to know too much about it Facebook gotten a lot of trouble a lot of fines dragged before Congress and in the UK over the Cambridge analytical Scandal um the idea was is that uh you can go into this as a great podcast um uh I think it's behind the lines uh Mike uh Michael Lewis the one who did the great short and all the rest he has a podcast with the guy who created Cambridge analogica and all the stats say that it had almost a negligible impact um but the perception was is that it caused brexit and so the perception was the reality and so they paid a fine and did all the rest of it and so what we get then are all sorts of ways in which news is circulating um the weird part about this one I don't want to get too much into it but macron was there was a false claim made against Emmanuel macron in France the consensus reporting was that it was false news everybody reported it as false but the debunking of it was that people believed it and that it had all of these ways in which it reproduced the debunking of it still reproduced the idea and so the one of the premises here is that we shouldn't call it fake news because that's not helping news has always had this problem of of propaganda of false balance of disinformation there's nothing really new about that it's just become a way to delegitimate all sources in order to produce reinforce the bubbleness of it um if the term fake news is insufficient and dangerous because it has been appropriated by politicians around the world to basically assert at anybody they don't like or they don't think is dealing with stuff so fake news is a mechanism to clamp down on Free Press and undermine Trust in Media um uh producing this all over and over again these these narratives over and over again I I don't know how much media we should trust but I do know that the digitization of it has reinforced this idea that we shouldn't engage with ideas that we don't like and so a better term for fake news is junk news because it saturates public debate leaving little space for other discussions and reducing the richness of public debate being heard um it's this idea this is back to durkheim which is again why I don't know any of this is new was was that um Collective phenomena would reduce everything to the simplest form of individual behaviors and their their Progressive we would stop thinking and we would just react and so when we talk about junk news production it's this is all media has always been like this we've always had tabloids we've always had this stuff but part of the defunding of news is that it produces more junk and so when we don't engage in those institutions that are worthy at least of some type of doing the work and keeping people accountable whoever they are we produce everything and this has already been the case with chat GPT we I think there's about at least 50 at this point news websites that are just churning AI created data over and over again in order to you know get caught up in search engines so when you type in a response you get whatever whatever the data is and it's just garbage data produced by AI that hasn't been checked it's not fact checked it's not anything it's junkiness it's pure and so when we automate news news Services we junk them but the long history of the AP is more complicated anyways so that there are five types of junk news production we could talk about um one it's just the establishment of a market so the buzz feedification of things like whatever the crazy headline is so there whatever the headline is so that everybody will go there um the idea of of junk news is something that I can produce my own news and you can listen to it I can do my own tick tocks uh technological this ways in which we propagate the news so that I can create I have a platform like Tick Tock where it can spread uh cultural this idea of creating a subculture for whatever furries whatever and then generating content for that group and then political in in the act of trolling and so hopefully we'll get to this there's a link in it here but this is the the crap test and so we should always do this this is this is time and Memorial this is kind of the purpose of the academy right if there's one thing the academy should do it should be thinking critical thinking that's it right at bare minimum it also provides degrees it's social sorting and it lets you um lets employers know that you're capable of having certain skill set right and then then you've got your area expertise but but it at a basic level you know is your Source up to date is the source relevant to your research where is it published who is the author so this has always been the problem with the economist The Economist doesn't have authors you never know who's saying what so when they decided to publish it why don't we have any people defending the long history of slavery as an economic institution nobody takes the direct heat they just have to retract the stupid article they did like three years ago and are they considered repeatable and trustworthy in their field and that's loaded right because that is epistemic bias right so if we all really like somebody or we all really hate somebody you're going to reproduce that problem in your Authority accuracy is it supported by evidence and are there claims cited correctly sure one of the problems with large language models is we don't know where the data is being drawn from and they claim that they're not producing new data they're just synthesizing data um and then what's the purpose behind motivating it so we always have to think about crap it's not just about junk news or fake news we always have to check whatever sources we have and the digitization of society shouldn't change the ways in which we think about that
 so the values that come then from these different Platforms in the social context in which they're embedded are necessarily going to reflect those values and ideas there was a Google employee who actually started a a subscription who was pushing for a subscription-based search system as an alternative to Google it never actually came to Canada it started in the US and now it's been destroyed um it's been destroyed because the premise was a search is fundamentally compromising your results SEO search engine optimization is you know being on the front page of Google is like 90 of your business if you can get there you you are so desperate to stay there you're willing to pay money to get to the front that's why the search is so bad that process the insidification in a search and so search has this way of reflecting social values and Google's kind of commercialism or you know shareholder value it's a business it's been doing that in the past though this idea was that there was all this data on the internet and the search was the way to get to it the problem is is that like in society search reproduces certain Norms because it's it's searching the dominant group it's searching for the most rather than the best so today I took it upon myself have to type into Google professional hairstyles for women guess what popped up all these white women all of these Karen's right let me searching Champion styles for men guess what popped up all these white men okay all right not the white man not the white man so I'm like okay let me see something let me type in unprofessional hairstyles for men guess what popped up my black men my black man tell me please I'm confused what is unprofessional about this a haircut dreads are unprofessional make it make sense okay so let's tape in unprofessional hairstyles for women guess what popped up this is unprofessional My Curls are unprofessional Google fix it because I don't like nothing about it I don't like so this is the problem and this is what Noble talks about in algorithms of Oppression is the search supposed to reflect the most if it's supposed to reflect the most then it's going to reflect dominant cultures values and ideas including racism if it's supposed to re reflect the truth which is that yes this is totally racist then you have to do what everybody's terrified of doing which is this idea of you should deal with the ways in which your depiction of the social world is reinforcing the racism of the social World which means then you should have Progressive search engines you should have politicized search results not that we haven't always had politicized search results because the search results are already racist but that if you want to counter these you should do that so Noble talks about this like just in profs so she has examples in your book and we have to screen cap this I do it all the time I screencap things because it's gone so what happened was if you typed in like University Professor you would get a whole bunch of white men you can see it now with with llms in chat or um mid-journey just in mid-journey you give it like the idea of what is this what is that people have already done it um that you could say like what does a university Professor look like what is this and so it's predominantly white people and older and they look a certain way and they have a certain style and all the rest of that so the problem which has always been here is that that's going to reflect those values so if we are changing that we are doing something else we are making search not search we are making search how we want search to be or how we envision Society to be search itself is a heavily contested concept and so we can't just do that and so you know um these ways in which what a search does I want to see if it's true so funny comedians okay pretty normal not funny comedians all women so what what I mean by we have to capture this data is that Google will go in once they hear about this and change the algorithm so they are always already doing this right they're doing what produces the most commercial outcome and all the rest of that but when they're doing it for profit we're like okay with it but when they do it because somebody brought attention to the fact that um university professors were all coming up as white then one of the algorithm then somebody on the back end goes in and change the algorithm we have no oversight over these things so one of the things that the gdpr the general data protection regulations in the European Union stemmed from was a Google versus Spain case where somebody in Spain said every time somebody searches my name in Google you're bringing up my bankruptcy that came up like 15 years ago that was in the news I should as a human right have a right to privacy and the right to be forgotten that the search shouldn't amplify something that Society has said I've discharged is in my past and I've moved on from and so the right to be forgotten is is about the political regulation of search and so we just don't have those regulations here they just simply don't happen here and so all of these books deal with these issues in Noble's book in particular deals with all of the kind of racism that's embedded in society that gets reflected in all of our data in all of our searches and so when we're thinking about digitally based politics then we have to think about the ways in which we're reproducing the politics and actions online um the this idea that we become I I mean for example if you're trying to mobilize and this is what's happening um so much of us are online that now the politicians have to spend all their money on these search engines which raises the question or these platforms like Facebook and Google all the rest of it but it raises the questions tick tock then do we what's the obligation of these platforms or should they be taking speech that is hateful that a politician is saying in their election campaign and remove it because it violates terms of service our terms of service more important than the values of the society and so you can see this in the reverse too if you say buy a platform and you decide you're going to be a free speech Advocate and you just literally remove all the trust and safety Engineers so that people are now using it to propagate searches for illegal content or child sex abuse material or things like that and you don't have the infrastructure there are you obligated to have that infrastructure and how should we regulate you so we've got a bunch of different examples here I'll bring them in surveillance misinformation and hashtag activism I mean surveillance is ubiquitous I kind of always has been I mean the church meeting a church at a church on Sunday is a form of social surveillance I'm visiting the temple and praying is a form of social surveillance we do this all the time and social surveillance and and information control right like about what what you should be reading what should be thinking what she'd be doing we've always done this um the idea here is that we're generating and so this is one of the attitudes of the gdpr is that data is should be perceived of as radioactive it's something you want to put in sites that are safe you want to minimize its exposure and you want to not have a lot of it um it's this is data minimization actually Canada has this as well in pipita it's their Privacy Information I can't ever remember personal Access Data act it's just like when I've asked let's say major government officials are you actually trying to data minimize here like you're expected to they're like why would we do that we have access to all this information we should use it and so we've got all these problems over and over again of of surveillance being in virtually every aspect of our life um and particularly authoritarian governments can monitor harass detained citizens um president yeah all over the place but I mean it's it's literally everywhere China's great firewall of China has a sophisticated surveillance economy um tens of thousands of people like to to monitor the internet report and block harmful content and I'm okay with blocking harmful content um we've always done it right uh some of the greatest works of literature were on the were written under the tsarist regime in Russia where you weren't allowed to use all sorts of words and so it makes people very creative when they have to work under under uh systems of censorship and control so I don't know that it's different I I think there's this belief that all good all information is good information but I think this whole lecture has been about democratization of Internet doesn't necessarily produce better outcomes if we don't have ways to socially or technologically or government forms of Regulation right I don't think that the top like draws on Tick Tock should be teenage girl dances when the bulk of their audiences are 50 plus year old men it seems to me that's a problem that somebody should address but we because of the the this kind of double blind of the company won't let us know what they see and we don't see what everyone's doing we think it's okay right and so we would hope that there is more systems uh this is an old classic example this is the Blackberry CEO being asked Point Blank about whether or not people in uh specifically I think was south Asia and the Middle East can be assured that they have security when they are using a BlackBerry device this is back when Blackberry mattered and you're confident that we we've got a lot of um uh listeners and and viewers in the Middle East and in India you can confidently tell them they're going to have no problems with being able to use their blackberries and you being able to give them assurance that everything um that's over interview's over please you can't use that Rory that's just not fair that's not fair well uh sorry I dealt with this come on this is a national security issue turn that off so perfect the National Security matter turn that off um so uh citizen Lab at U of T Ron debert's been doing this work for a couple decades now a couple decades yeah I guess we're at a couple decades um so they have lots of evidence on this all the ways in which this has happened so these are this is this data is a bit old now doesn't matter it's probably got worse I think there's a bunch of Western Nations on this list too so um open it information allows us to to audit it to review it and so this was one of the things that they looked at and so they had evidence of filtering by all of those countries they had suspected filtering in Belarus and Kazakhstan and these were the types of things that were being filtered um from the internet everything from Human Rights women's rights environmental issues Economic Development Public Health gay lesbian content pornography dating gambling alcohol or drugs minority faiths hacking blogging free emails search engines P2P commercial sites I think we should regulate hate speech I think there should be regulations on who can access pornography and gambling those are things that I understand their regulation I just don't know how you ask people in positions of authority to then say that we're not going to just add another word to that cue list that gets banned and so this idea of of digital surveillance has increasingly shown that we are doing these things all the time as well that's what Snowden was saying is that the NSA is actively spying on people and let's be clear they're one of the first things in the report that happened the employees that have access to this surveillance this happens almost uniformly it was happening with the nest cameras I think it was happening with Amazon and it was happening with the NSA one of the first things they get access to and share are their exes nudes because they have access to it on the back end and this has been well documented and so the idea here is that if you give this power to people without oversight the first thing they do is immediately exploit the power right because it's powerful and they want to use it and so um you want to have law enforcement to to combat all of those things it's just that for example in combating trafficking concerns cesta and Foster were passed in the U.S which basically shut down the capacity for sex workers to have forums where they regulated the people that they interacted with including those that would cause them physical harm and so the idea of regulating trafficking is also used as a Prohibition regime against sex work so it creates there there isn't any way to regulate without producing these consequences intended or unintended and so digital surveillance is how we track Travelers it is what is Need for for intelligence right you can't have intelligence without surveillance it's part of it the question is who should be doing their surveillance and what can they do and all the rest of it one of the weird interesting Parts about having this security intelligence sharing system that we've had with the five eyes network is that technically if the U.S takes data that it gets on Canadian citizens it can fully surveil it because they're foreigners and then it can provide the the summary of that data back to the Canadians as actionable Intel but that doesn't hold up in a Canadian court because they're they're um we would have to get that data through legal means we have protections Canadian government cancer Villas but the other four can and we can surveil the other four as well and so it creates this web of surveillance by uh security Partners who want to be able to do things and still respect privacy and rights um and so you know I don't really care about the covet alert app like it was clear Bruce Schneider said immediately the the kova detection app wouldn't work because of apartment buildings right being next to an apartment where somebody has covered the tracking and surveillance it rendered it moot right and it simply wasn't adopted you will not have all of these systems depend on the idea that Engineers come up with well if we have a hundred percent use of this technology it will work we don't have anything like that we we took the longest time it took Snowden before we had our websites put basic https Security on them until we had https that meant that everything you were doing on the internet could be surveilled by almost anybody at any time right like it this is not the systems were not based on security back to the stuff of the first video so what we now have is private companies actually developing this software for these companies or for these countries so the NSO group in particular has been highlighted for this because they have this uh a pegasus spyware I think it was used to hack Bezos right that's that's what led to his divorce um was the um trying to blackmail him with this information he just came out and said no I did it and you can't get anything on me um and so the idea here is that this is a private firm operating out of um Israel that uh has access it will buy security exploits so if you have a vulnerability you've discovered covered in Apple or Android it will buy that from the person and then keep it proprietary so they can send messages to your phone immediately take it over with no notification from you so Apple in particular and meta as well have pushed for the US to ban this company because it's effectively undermining the National Security and foreign interests of the US this company is but it's just as available to places like Pakistan and it was probably used to as part of the murder of Jamal khashoggi which is what Saudi Arabia did and so this technology then is being used to facilitate the violation of Human Rights by one company in one country and so this idea of of these digital Technologies producing better outcomes we can also see the ways in which it's being used by states to effectively surveil monitor attack and undermine the interests of what they see as dissidents in their societies
 okay um let's discuss uh digital technology and democracy um yeah a couple things so I mean this is probably the week I mean the timeline's outlet order here um where I I probably am going to make the basic versions of the Powerpoints available um just because like you so you can see my Edition but can you all see the data because I like the texts are okay but they missed the point sometimes it's why we're not using the international orders week and we're not using the ipe week they're they're too General they're not giving us a good analysis and I don't feel they're they're contributing a lot um I normally teach the Cyber politics course which is fourth year course so I have lots of data from that so I'm going to bring in some of those examples some of the data some of those tick tocks those type of things so what are we going to talk about today um unpack the concept of digital politics a bit I have a tough time knowing the difference and I mean I I've seen this many times with cybernetics predates computers the application of technology to the political world has always been a thing and it never won't be a thing and so we just are trying to identify maybe ways that politics has changed certainly there's new things like a deep fake is kind of new um though we've always had propaganda and we've always had you know misinformation and disinformation like that's basic Warfare right like all that stuff existed so we're going to try to identify ways in which things have changed I I'm I tend to be a bit of a skeptic on the like the radical transformation that has taken place normally what and this is this goes back to the we have never been modern LaTour stuff right it's his insights are that like yes you can use the internet to prove the flat earth right like there's no necessarily teleological foundation for new technologies there certainly can be increases in productivity but what that means is always socially embedded right um and supporting and threatening democracy again I don't think those claims can be made we can have positive this chapter does it we can do positive or negative ways of thinking about it um and so there's a couple things I mean it's kind of complicated maybe I think this generation's the most heavily digital users that we've had but they're not particularly you don't understand because of the way that we've developed it like the language encodes are are not transparent to you whereas with early internet we would have had to learn a bit of coding to do stuff right so those types of things so the ways in which we understand the world changes um you know a broad range of applications and devices that connect to one another I would say not necessarily necessarily through an internet because you can have a network with it that's not connected to the internet right um and digital Technologies websites emails social media instant messaging podcasting mobile devices sure video audio those type of things um and so this idea then of having digitally enabled politics and digitally based politics um sure that that boundary really doesn't hold and so Technologies may be new but digital politics has been around since the 1990s um what no no no no no no no um so when we teach the cyber attacks these go back to the 80s 70s 60s we have been having technology enabled forms of political um messing about I don't know if you call Crime political or not anyways so what we have here this is a whistle that came in boxes of Captain Crunch and the um early telephone systems so when there used to be a thing called pay phones where in public places you would put money in in order to use a phone uh the ways in which those phones told the system that you had paid was by the the tones that it um emitted unfortunately this Captain Crunch whistle emitted the exact same tones as the money uh putting it into a pay phone so people figured out that they could hack these systems very early on MIT has been doing hacking for for decades hacking is just the unauthorized or unpredicted use of a technology in a way that wasn't predicted so the idea here is that if we're going to talk about things like technology I think starting at the 90s makes very little sense because some of these questions are the exact same questions we've been dealing with since the 1960s probably maybe even a bit before the um you know computers are basically big filing cabinets right so they have data um that everybody either wants to get access to or we want to stop people from getting access to um and so the NSA has been working with these systems the National Security Agency in the US since the 60s in almost every form and so um the main problem is not that these Technologies are new it's that humans use them and so their human vulnerabilities throughout individual accidents or deliberate acts can jeopardize the information in a system like these are Insider threats we've got them all the time we've always had them in spying and so just having technology enabled doesn't change the fact that we've always tried to get people to spy for us and against us and so these are all built into computer computers communication systems consoles they have vulnerabilities in the systems organized so you can like the the oldest form of kind of social engineering is just you know calling up someone and say oh my computer's not working give me your password or you know all of these sophisticated phishing attacks we get now oh it's your boss can you just uh shoot me over you know 25 I need it blah blah blah I got hit last year everybody in our department got an email from the chair saying oh I need some I think it was the Amazon gift cards and at first it looked like it came from the proper address because the way that um westerns Microsoft uh kerning the the literal fonts allow it to manipulate us because what might actually be an r and an N looks like an m so it looks like it comes from a real address or it can be spoofed and so the idea here this isn't new right um you know who are the class of users what's the environment what's the skill um you know all of these these problems have always existed so to say that like cyberpolitics is new I may be in the political round but I'll give you examples that that's not true either so since the 60s we know that computers could spill sensitive data since the 70s we know computers could be attacked and data was stolen in the 80s and 90s we knew that we you know could build computer techs into nuclear arsenals and that others may be trying to to do so and developing these things so as early as 1968 the NSA had had um five acres of floor space working on Computing problems and so we'll talk about this throughout this this week but this is I I do think the insights of cyber politics is it's a good critique of the idea of security as conceived of by the state as a noun rather than security as a verb as we've got some level of security but that level of security is constantly changing because someone just figured out oh this Captain Crunch whistle can break into our phone systems right and so absolute security is largely fictive you can spend an infinite amount on security um you can you can spend more and more but this is the old what it was in politics called guns or butter so as a society you can either spend 800 billion on the military or you can spend the 800 billion on development infrastructure and internet Technologies which allow you to mess with the society instead of spending 800 billion I don't know which one's better certainly if you're going into a war you want guns but if you're not in a war having seems to make more sense and so when it comes to security you can spend all of your butter on on security but at some point you're basically going to have to accept that there's a level of vulnerability here and so we aren't ever secure we have forms of security or degrees of security and so we use security like a noun when it really should be a verb this is the recent one now I have a phone right now that um uh Reddit uh the Reddit app will not install on because it's an old version of the Android operating system and um I think it's Motorola and Motorola refuses to put updates into it um so I can't get on to the latest version of apps and stuff um and these system Securities and vulnerabilities are are baked into the the hardware now so should I stop using it because it's not secure even though it functions but it just increasingly over time is less functional on some things it's perfectly fine device but increasingly we have these problems where it's two years out firms will not update the security on your phone which makes it super vulnerable and so this idea of at least providing us with some idea of how long you're going to get updates on your phone would would be important because your personal security all your stuff's on your phone and if you're telling me that a phone only lasts two years and I'm on a three-year payment plan that seems to be a problem and these phones like an Apple phone being worth you know upwards to two thousand dollars so it's weird these problems are not just virtual they are deeply political problems too um what happened was uh back in the 70s and 80s somebody put a training tape into one of the early nuclear defense systems it showed uh on November 9th 1979 it uh warning screen showed 1400 Soviet IB icbms approaching North America and NORAD concluded that an attack was underway um that said uh they got this and the the um I consider the situation very serious they almost went to nuclear war they almost fired their uh question their all of their missiles in response to somebody putting the wrong tape in the system um that seems political to me I the death of every human on the planet because somebody puts a wrong tape and seems like a problem um and so what this did it created this they made a movie out of it Matthew broderick's war games um and then it becomes this thing and this happens all the time in cyber security somebody conceives of something in a fiction space and then that becomes conceived of as a security threat and so actual fiction work is framing how we secure we see ourselves so this this war Games movie comes out and then Ronald Reagan references it in a joint uh Jesus staffs meeting the high school students see this and they create a hacking group and they find basically that there's about 8 000 Network systems back in the 80s without any security and the high school kids are just able to mess around with them right um so early on the NSA starts setting standards for for research and security for all government systems um you know in 1986 we have had 75 accounting error that that discovered that West German hackers have been paid by the KGB to enter into all the networks and it was that accounting era that allowed them to discover that their their networks were totally insecure and had been run over and so the idea here is that information Warfare isn't new um these ideas of having systems that are vulnerable that are also information providers is going to um uh to tell the groups what's happened I saw a thing um when they were planning the the Normandy invasion we sent over thousands of inflatable tanks and weapon systems inflatable so that we would provide disinformation actively to the enemy who thought our troops were over here when they're there so the idea of providing information as part of warfare isn't anywhere new I mean the Trojan Horse is the we still call them Trojans right the the idea of providing false information here's a gift that's actually a threat is as old as politics I would say and so we don't have and this is what the NSA discovered that there is no such thing as a kind of a secure system as long as humans are involved there's going to be vulnerabilities I mean after the the Snowden leaks the head of the NSA said we're going to try to fire every single human and men and try to do this all with with um programming and system and algorithms because humans are vulnerable humans are security risk right um as all sci-fi tells us and so you know this idea of of having security especially in a cyber space is very um suspect the NSA by the 80s says we don't think we can secure any system that all systems are built on code and all code is vulnerable to to to either Hardware or software vulnerabilities and those vulnerabilities make us insecure um and so I mean the Pentagon holds hack the Pentagon events now to try to figure out where all their insecurity is it used to be keep the hackers away now it's no let's bring in all the Securities Google does this all the all the software companies do this they they provide incentives now for to find bugs find hacks find fix and we'll pay you so we can close it um and we do this all the time that um you know uh the we're trying to develop new security standards so right now they're working on the uh the post Quantum cryptography standards so the the National Institute for standards and technology in the US has been holding competition for going on years now trying to figure out what's the system we can use that is quantum proof so when they develop these quantum computers we can be sure that our data isn't going to be instantly um insecure by these systems um they had a bunch of Front Runners and then you subject everybody to them and one of them that they'd already made it through several rounds of competition somebody found a paper from 1997 that said oh by the way there's a massive vulnerability we can't use that anymore and so this idea of of systems being secure um is a problem of humans aren't secure and so this is a famous XKCD um discussion of how stupid passwords are fundamentally if we went back in time we would get rid of passwords um they don't make sense they are really hard for humans to remember and they're very easy for systems to crack and we haven't developed them this idea that we have to rotate them and come up with them and have all of these these complex mathematical ways to to do this it I have really made these systems passwords in particular have I been pawned just check if your password has been compromised I believe mine's company compromised 26 30 times one of them's on a forum for Xboxes the original Xbox I used to mod them so you could play like pirated games um I can't delete it from that Forum the The Forum has no capacity for me to delete it my data is there forever and so I used a password like 15 years ago that's still there and it can't be changed it's not going to be changed there's no point changing it right so it doesn't this over and over again so we don't develop systems that are human based we develop systems for technology and then are shocked when humans become the vulnerability and so this idea is that in the the 1960s these problems of computer cyber security were too difficult to solve on their own and most of them still haven't been solved some of them are at the basic level and so what we get then is this danger of thinking of Technology as outside of politics and security what I'm going to try to do is re-embed them and say all of these issues are actually just the same social issues we've been dealing with before we think that things will provide things so we think that crypto is going to fix the broken money system we think that I don't know web 3 is going to decentralize the internet we think that large language models are going to break the way that we do things maybe in ways but if there was something like a uniform surface of humans that might make sense we are not a uniform surface of humans and that is to say there are a bunch of assumptions built in to a lot of this technological stuff that is based in Silicon Valley where I'll talk about the Silicon Valley ethos move fast break things white males envisioning a space upon which they can create whatever they want where this is standard kind of subtler colonial stuff it's built into technology and then we get all of these ways in which we react to that technology if as if technology is problem not Society right like this has been arguments in the past about technology birth control makes people promiscuous um still one of the reasons that the you know the Catholic church for example has had such a a history with birth control um uh junk food makes people violent this was literally the defense used in the killing of of Harvey Milk um the first kind of famous politician who was who was gay um video games are addictive okay what isn't addictive public cars and public transportation are making people obese sure I don't know we find them appealing though to kind of like say that technology is outside of politics or outside of the social and that when you dig into it you see that we just replicate all these patterns on different platforms but I guess it sounds new to say that technology has changed everything in order to get more interest in technology changing everything it becomes a kind of tautological system
 okay so this is the textbook video and the conclusion yes things are both positive and negative okay but they're very contested as well um it can also you know it could lead to empowerment I don't know if it leads does democracy breed democracy or does democracy breed group think I'm not sure um of course they vary across political systems they reflect those systems and that it's going to to be an issue we didn't really talk about the digital divide it's it's become more complicated in recent years um primarily because there are more cell phones on the internet than people at this point I'm pretty sure um saturation is I mean most people have at least one sitting in a drawer somewhere now totally wasteful but whatever um and so the question is you know in many places this is only like text based access but you know there's lots of places that have you know especially throughout Africa have the primary means of paying us through a cell phone so it's also that kind of banking and all the rest of it I don't know yes they're in terms of high-speed internet access there's absolutely divides a particular encounter because our infrastructure is so clustered and our population is so distributed particularly with indigenous communities so there are still basic access issues Arctic for example I wrote a paper on Arctic internet access years ago um and so this idea then is is that we are we reproduce more inequalities all the time one of the gross truisms of the kind of tech sector is whenever they and try to increase the um EDI D equality diversification decolonization of these sectors as they generally go down in terms of pay it's gross so the question then becomes are they doing it on purpose or not and so the exclusivity of your information and your abilities is what drives up your income and the more skills that people have the lower people are going to pay for it right and so this idea of inclusion and exclusion just being based in the ideas themselves no it's based on who gets to speak and how why you would so many cool things on the internet and why we just talk to a Prof and I guess because it's just on the associate press you can get it for free I don't know let's listen to it it's a problem because people believe it and they don't know the difference between what's real and what's not I don't know the difference between what's real and what's not we didn't talk about this at all I did want to talk about this a kind of the digital appropriation but this idea that if we can create all these virtual spaces are we going to create boundaries on what you're going to put what your touch-up levels and settings are on things are we going to have these debates about how we should accurately portray ourselves online what we should and shouldn't include I think we're we're seeing a really troubling time with news consumption right now where people are going to sources that confirm what they already think when a fake news article appears in their social media feed and they like the way it sounds they don't bother to vet whether it's true or not and they pass it on and then somebody else passes it on and pretty soon you have everybody believing that something has happened when it hasn't of course it's dangerous I mean we have a long history of false flags being used to start wars it can be wrong but be useful and we should be conscious of that I also don't know like what is a hypothesis it's just a wild claim that you have to support with evidence right okay isn't that what we all do I mean look what look what happens I mean somebody thought that that news in quotations was worthy of investigating and took a rifle and and went after the the pizza parlor I don't know how we stop it that pizza parlor that apparently had a basement where all this bad stuff was happening except it didn't actually have a basement I mean people love fake news they love a good conspiracy theory I mean we're at a period in American history where they're an awful lot of people who are have you heard of the Salem witch hunts and the witch trials I'm not sure that fake news is new I just think that maybe the social utility of it isn't being utilized to maximum degree again Iraq war fearful of establishment who want change but that change what was the premise of the Vietnam War right like the premise was the Domino Theory so because academics said it was so we should all go fight and die to stop the spread of Communism which by the way Vietnam is now communist so I just just coming at a cost and that cost is we are not better informed just because we have more sources of information we're less informed because we're not looking for news we're not looking for so what's the I've been struggling with this lately what is the point of a debate I think debate is more in the realm of rhetoric than reason because if you really want to reasonably assess the veracity of a policy you would need to know what the outcome is going to be the problem is is in our open system we don't know what the outcomes are going to be we try to achieve them and then we reproduce myths all the time so trichodon economics still maintains it's still put out there um all IMF the World Bank everybody has said trickle Downs economics does not work it's not true but people still believe it and they adopt it as a policy and they tell it to people and those people say well I'm going to vote for that person because they believe that that making my taxes smaller or that my taxes paying less taxes produces better outcomes right or that if you give more money to the people at the top it trickles down to the bottom no evidence to support that but when we know there's no evidence to support that and policy makers still support it we're in the realm of rhetoric and I think all policy is rhetoric because we it's not truth it's the implementation of its certain idea and then the world will either correspond to that idea or not so I don't know um am I a cyber Optimist skeptic or pessimist I don't know you tell me um what are digitally supported politics lots of them um what type of digital politics have you engaged in I don't know what that is is it any form of like if I found out so let's say I went to a protest because I found out a bit through an email I said digital politics what if I in the past found it out through a flyer is that media politics I'm not sure so we have these cyberoptopism skepticism uh I'm clearly I think the skeptic a digital campaigning digital government digital based identity surveillance hashtag actor has a misinformation there's no disinformation which I think it needs to be there I also think sharp power should be on there it's likely one that I would want to put on evaluation like in terms of an exam
 so we've largely talked about gender to this point um but we can talk about this idea of the sexual contract um we understand how the positionality of of bodies again this is so binary um bodies that resist binary classifications uh the political system is based upon gendered and sexual relationships through the idea of establishing women often married women having citizenship rights and property rights because they're married and so women couldn't be citizens on their own or access their rights on their own without the privilege of marriage and this is still there today it exists today we have all sorts of ways in which compensation taxation attitudes opinions legal rights are different if you are in heterosexual relationships versus other forms of relationships the idea then is that we have used marriage as the framework of understanding because it has ties to religious sensibilities as the framework of co-opting um Alternative forms organizing your social life and we have differential regulation of of the private so this is the public private split and so marriages is the idea of of the legitimate form of lgbtq Rights comes through marriage and marriage rights which doesn't make a ton of sense because there's lots of rights that fall outside of that and that what I'm talking about here is that we've seen this we've seen this in places like Russia pushing back the idea of domestic violence gender-based violence violence against women in the home as being domestic and therefore not of scrutiny by the state whereas for indigenous communities we still have all of these efforts to take babies away literally immediately after birth from their mothers um it's still it's still an issue it's still a Perpetual issue so we're willing to go and do that for marginalized communities but we're not even willing to look inside the communities in rich areas I mean I've we have friends who are police officers and and she has mentioned the ways in which um there are places that they never get calls to or if they get calls to there's going to be so many mechanisms before they get calls that would lawyers and all the rest of it would make it very difficult to even investigate those types of issues and so the sexual contract then depends on and reinforces hetero patriarchy this idea of patriarchy combined with Notions of heterobonding that reinforce legal cultural and political attitudes towards what is the dominant form of social organization I'm not saying it's a dominant form of social organization because we know at this point it's really not statistically it's not even dumb that we're moving away from that um that the you know um life expectancy of women shoots up after their husbands die that we have lots of examples of um now people not getting cohabitating without being married and we have children being born and raised outside of traditional forms not even tradition Western forms of heteroseocial relationships right um I wanted to do a a Venn diagram of the ways in which rationality gender and this is the lagunas and towards the decolonial gender the way in which Humanity Madness colonizer colonized and then colonized man colonized women and then two-spirit indigenous non-rational and other bodies fit outside but it would just take too long and it's there anyway this is the idea of intersectionality the overlapping Venn diagrams of who counts and how they count and the ways in which they're represented or non-represented in the system the the kind of the stupid debates that happen from people um you know the the literal president of the international genetics Federation being told he doesn't know what he's talking about because somebody on the internet believes otherwise and so this idea of telling bodies what they should be doing you know it's it's kind of built into the premise of dominant social organizations the ways in which we produce gender binaries heteropatriarchy and sexual uh contracts as ways in which we produce settler colonialism um two-spirit is a catch-all term from LGBT uh Q conference in Winnipeg in the 1990s I've got data here um specifically they're at least 168 indigenous languages in the U.S alone that describe um two-spirit people so two-spirit is another word that doesn't really mean anything it's just like the dominant group trying to come up with something to address the fact that it hasn't even started to understand what the problem is indigenous peoples labeled as inferior and civilized because they didn't adhere to these settler beliefs and Indigenous women's rights were actually undermined by Western Notions of of uh political representation and rights because we go back to the traditional status of the the Longhouse the hot dinner the the women and the elders had a very specific role in political organization which they were kicked out of and so the denial of matrilineal material linearity that should be matrilineality um indigenous women's property rights and two-spirit people I mean genetically we should always Trace through the women's side but we do it through the men's because patriarchy um and then we've disrupted the structures the cultures and the strength of indigenous communities um there's this continuous and massive misreading ignorance and imposition of values as natural how about Canada um there's a government Canada website they used to do at one of those you know Heritage minutes back in the day talking about how the name Canada is a fundamental misrecognition of uh karchay and his understanding when people told him hey that's the village down there he's like nah that's this whole place it's Canada and they're like no no that's the village he didn't understand and so now we have our country name based on a misunderstanding um and that this idea then of that we had this um this idea of supra binary genders I like that idea that they can do either that they're super um that they're better than our genders because they get to move around and they get to be different and they don't conform to standards um was framed by anthropologists who encountered indigenous communities as they use the word beardic you don't have to get into it too much here but it's um it was a form of prisoners used for sex purposes um and so even the language that we have like two Spirits better than that but it's still not great and so we're barely scratching the surface of of how naming and the ability to name these problems is still so much bound up in dominant groups that we can't articulate even the beginnings of what some type of freedom from these these Concepts would look like
 so as I talked about in the last video this idea of it being a concern to the majority is again referring back to the idea of the the social and the majority of the social who then binds together through things like the social contract um so again this is one of the problems of having the chapters written by different authors is that in part you're going to get these ways in which the contract is framed differently so um search contract again we've talked about Hobbs locks and lock and Rousseau but there's also these ideas of the racial contract and the sexual contract which is just the agreement by which a social organization bounds together in the regulatory Norms that come to be understood as as whatever that contract is right so this decides in a you know classic social contract sense as we've talked about who gets civil political and social rights how much freedom of the person do you have freedom of speech thought and Faith right to own property engaging contracts and rates to Justice the problem is with the way that this is framed and the problem we have in thinking about this in terms of these issues is that are these inherent or are they entitlements the danger of the state-based framework that we have done since the beginning of the discussion about politics the political and the state is that it starts from the Assumption of the king the leader the ruler as the because we are advising the king the ruler the leader it's not at all clear that's how rights actually happen it's more often than not it's as we talked about with anarchism the community coming together to demand something and them being like okay just don't overthrow us we'll give you this as in order to not do that so the question of entitlements um entitlements often have to do with political mobilization and the dominant group is saying this is what we should get but you also have this problem of you know small minority groups having influence over power and influence we could just talk about like a billionaire class right the ability of them to influence the political outcome based more strongly on their capacity to have influence through money right um and then we have the problem of if there is a complaint that my right is being violated who's going to adjudicate those complaints if it's the dominant group then you've got real problems um and then how do we establish that that degree upon which who can participate and how um so even these idea of gender normativity gender roles and who should play and how they should play in those roles is going to be part of the issue here and so this idea of of establishing just the rights themselves and then the expansive vision of rights that the chapter talks about doesn't really talk about how those rights are contested and how they come about and the extent to which they are based in a tacit liberal teleology right as we've talked about throughout the idea that liberals believe that reason is driving forward uh progress and reason will result in positive outcomes for groups as they are able to clearly articulate their claim for rights that's just not how the history of this has happened and we've seen this already with women rights in the last 10 years um the undp just did a report the last 10 years we've seen a regression in women's rights so the idea that they naturally progress forward is is very much this based on this teleology that's not based on evidence or fact right and so we have the expansion of of social rights that takes place especially um during the Cold War the the Communist systems were arguing that we're providing social benefits social rights economic welfare security and the ability to live upon these standards that we have set that are different from your Western standards or outside those standards and they're a different way to do it we've seen this when we talked last week about undrip this idea of group group or intersectional rights that are just now coming about and then we've got this broader question about the next set of are we going to be able to establish the non-human world as having inherent environmental rights animal rights the rights to live the rights for us to live in some type of balance with our environment so therefore there isn't a right to pollute for those things and so the the idea here is that framing things in terms of Rights is always going to introduce a level of intervulnerability because it's going to say we're going to have to have somebody to to establish the rights enforce the rights adjudicate the rights and defend those rights and so the idea of of having a a sense of self that is secure is going to be a better community that can establish a basis whereby you're not going to face threats to your to your sense of self your sense of justice and that hierarchies themselves are always going to undermine that by providing a level of impunity for those who are able to to set the terrain of the debate right the how we think about these things and who we we think about about what is reasonable and what isn't reasonable for a time during patent medicine it was the idea of you know the freedom to develop whatever product you want and put it on the market even if it's for kids and it's cough syrup and it has alcohol cannabis chloroform morphine hydrochloride chloride in it as a as a sedative and expectorant um and this idea then that that these are how we establish um that this is somehow something we need to regulate or something we need to say um that we should do this and so rights are not equally uh allocated or protected to everyone the right to property in in the patent medicine case comes at the expense of our Collective rights to you know not have our kids be drugged and uh facing other consequences of that like patent medicine what they gave to babies back in the day was just Bonkers um and so um this long history of exclusionary practices and laws um are all over the place uh you know women denying the right to vote until 1918 and then in the provinces it it moves around after that Japanese Canadians uh banned from voting until 1949 and this idea of limiting enfranchisement is still bound up in the idea that we have a majority ages where you can vote we haven't really we don't really talk about I guess it's capacity when you're elderly about whether or not you're right to vote or be the leader of the country about age limits term limits those ideas about maybe people shouldn't be in positions of power and authority if they don't have the capacity to do it but then we have to adjudicate their capacity right and one person's capacity isn't another's capacity so who should bound that and how should we decide and which groups get to decide then and so the danger of course is that if we heavily regulate some bodies um and then we're like whoa why is this outcome happening I have no idea why it's the case um you will see that that's the case and so particularly we can Target and look at the ways in which these groups have been targeted over time um just literally not being able to vote until 1960 the gendered provisions of the ACT we've talked about this before but losing status but losing status is is more than it also loses your ability to participate in the community from which you you come and then having Outsiders decide which is still the case today Outsiders just decide the legitimacy of certain type markers of identity and then what what benefits are conferred like education and spending and access to health care is still very much this majoritarian minority uh problem and so this idea of of but I just I literally was looking up one of these memes beforehand and ran into a current Reddit post of talking about because I was trying to find stuff on the the Indian act as a as a kind of racist holdover just in terms of the naming of it right like language um and then a bunch of like simulatory the arguments being made over and over again it's like we've learned literally nothing through all this time and so indigenous women's rights come through legal challenges they come through political mobilization um this ability to to go to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1973 and articulate no no you you're undermining our our political rights and capacity or going to the human rights committee in 1979 and saying we are being targeted for forms of Oppression and exclusion from basic human rights and so the capacity of basic human rights and being able to articulate them and having a place to do that so having the ability to to to how to stand in front of the Supreme Court or the human rights committee and make those claims is this issue and so it's not until 1985 that we get some of these these issues through the uh Senator Sandra Nichols um you know being in 2005 the ability to to make these choices and not have them made for you is all about these relationships of dynamics of control I'm not going to talk about the impunity here I was going to talk about Haiti um I think it'll conflict the argument a bit too much I just have the special repertoire for human rights in Haiti saying that the UN the one that assigned the special repertoire to talk about human rights and it was violated by the UN and because of that they have impunity and there is no mechanism no feedback mechanism um for those issues that came from that we have these impunities all over the place we frame things like uh teenage pregnancy as a problem of um social concern but we frame that social concern and I saw this one this was a meme going around about the idea of 15 year old girls fathering children from men who were 20 to 29. we frame that as a as an issue of sexual moral Panic about who's having sex with who but not about the idea that this is inappropriate or there are structures in place here this this idea of victim blaming is built into if you allow the majority Community to set the terrain back to that Meme from the first time where you have somebody clearly articulating their sense of self and then the dominant group just gets to interpret what that articulation means and so we have serious substantive issues about if we're just now coming to terms with recognizing the existence of groups to articulate their vision of Rights we haven't even started listening to those rights yet
 so we have a lot of discussion this chapter about um the gender binary sure if we're challenging the Western gender binary reproducing the gender binary in what we see kind of seems like we're losing before we started but okay we don't call them spectrums we don't call them polls we don't want to talk about that um I mean women have been occluded from excluded from the social contract because they were unfit it's deeper than that I would say going back to Aristotle it was a notion that they weren't fully human and that this has plays over in colonialism and how we think about these things and that we still have claims today about um talking about women's rights or or you know no fault divorce I think I've got a tick talk about no fault divorce just the idea that that we can directly correlate these things I looked it up and I made sure I checked the study but like that this the suicide rate for women drops by 20 if you have no fault divorce and we have multiple states in the U.S trying to move away from no fault divorce at the present um so I you know from this idea that that somehow men have the right to make reasonable discussions a reasonable arguments and debates and that other other non-men um don't I'm trying to avoid the binary language it's built into how we think about the west and how we think about this I mean you know especially the Germanic or the Latin languages all have their gendered um kind of holdovers and how we think about these things I'll try to do this I we'll just state it women are denied citizenship rights we as in general in the west reinforce gender binaries dividing people into opposing categories I don't think we need to to talk about that and then we frame them as oppositional male and female I don't know if I agree with any of this um not that we don't put people into opposing categories and not that we don't do big lumping uh things I just don't know where the boundary is so I don't like to think of them as as a binary as on off I like to think them as like spectrums or polls or ways of being and so it assigns characteristics and abilities and roles to those different spectrum's polls their oppositional mutually exclusive maybe um I think this is oversimplifying it um we'll talk about this a bit when we get to sex and sexuality I don't have any idea what people do with their junk and what it means back to that fundamental premise of polymorphously perverser we we have I mean I've done research a little bit of research on the men who have sex with men um specifically um in the relation of States using grinder to um Target men who have sex with men for violations of crimes in places like Egypt or whatever then it raised questions about the West having you know data controls so that places that have the capacity your phone gives away everything your phone is as close to your junk every day as anything is and it tracks you and tells you where you've been and tells you what you've done and so one of the problems for men who have sex with men is that it doesn't necessarily relate to their gender sexual identity hence the idea of the closet that that men can be straight and have sex with men and and men can do all sorts of things with other people and other ways in which they do things and it doesn't have any relationship to their Identity or their sexuality as they conceive of it right and so that's the point of denial and so coming back to this this idea of the social contract trying to Define what identities are and say that like you know marriage is the goal of identities doesn't make any sense historically or anything else it's very a very narrow specific post-war nuclear family view of how we think about gender identity and the relationship of identity to sexuality um bodies are constantly resisting this and this is largely a social story about how identities are formed through the nation-state it's the contract part of the social contract again it's fictional it's not based on historical evidence or practice or anything like that it's just based on these conceptual ideas that we've come up with in political theory that do this and so this this gender binary it doesn't really exist doesn't have any essential characteristics they're fluid they change back and forth they're they're asserted over and over again as mutually exclusive but they rarely hold bodies identify as much as they identify I went just looking at this okay most simple stupid framing from the argument we were having earlier about um what what is taking out the garbage right it's stupid social effectivity does it even need to be thought of in terms of gender I don't think so but it doesn't really tell us anything either because I went and looked up and I've seen this over and over again so this is from Reader's Digest I think the link is there if you click the image and then the PowerPoint um department stores jumped on board with Time Magazine showing this idea that there were sex appropriate colors again the language here is a mess um that uh boys should dress in pink um and that uh the color change was that that pink and blue for a certain time uh blue is for girls Penguins for boys then their argument is is that in the 1940s manufacturers went the opposite direction and decided pink was for girls and blue was for boys so okay I want to check this out right so this is where it's from this reader Sergeant so I go I look up Wikipedia Wikipedia is this entry despite popular belief uh including for various uh popular sources the reported pink blue reversal wherein the gendered associations were flipped during the 20th century most likely never occurred and is instead likely to have been a misunderstanding from early reporting Wikipedia has no sources here there's no discussion here is basically tell us about your high school's kids on the Wikipedia page deciding where gender is great what could go wrong um and so in a in 1927 a chart for Time Magazine reported a major number of department stores six said pink for boys and blue for girls four said the opposite so we never agreed on this at all um I went and looked this up academically so these are two sources in 2012 we have this discussion um was it a scientific urban legend that we coded gender with pink and blue and the binaries the first article talks about um yes it repeats the same idea that it's a myth then after publishing the article the author gets a bunch of feedback and it's like well let's look at this again so this in 2017 the last sentence of the 2017 article is clearly there's more than to pink and blue than meets the eye and a wealth of fascinating questions we have barely started to answer nobody has any idea about this stuff so the idea of producing gender binaries just because somebody tells somebody to take out the garbage ah sure maybe it's a gender binary I will go with somebody who is cited probably the most in all of social sciences uh Judith Butler the terms such as masculine amphemeral are notoriously interchangeable there are social histories for each term they change radically depending on geopolitical boundaries cultural constraints who's imagining them for what purpose that the terms recurs interesting enough but the recurrence doesn't index sameness doesn't even mean it's the same thing over space and time the way in which the social articulation of the term depends on its repetition constitutes one of the dimensions of ways in which genders performative it's it's I mean it's a great lie right oh I'm going to tell my wife listen we are bucking against the dominant Norm that men take out the garbage it's your job to take out the garbage like you know what I mean we can do whatever we want with this and play with it as much as we want terms of gender designation never settled and are constantly in the process of being remade yes I agree what's an example I'll give you an example this is the report from the arbor report in 2022 on the widespread and pervasive sexual misconduct in the Canadian military this follows the de Champs report in 2015. so this came out 2022. it's not that old um the reason that gender iframe as gender is a failure of identification why the binary doesn't hold is because again starting from my premise the gender is a present to all bodies Norms fail in bodies over time so even in then this is the case over and over with with militaries right they have a warrior masculine culture great except you get old your body fails you're no longer able to achieve that veterans by definition are aging out of that identity they get new identities so you try to make the veteran into a specific type of identity except the veterans from World War II veterans from Vietnam veterans from the Iraq War all have very different experiences based on the perception of society but their role in that conflict that but the ways in which society recognized that PTSD shell shock was the thing and that they made sure that those coming back from World War II had to spend six weeks getting reacclimatized whereas in the Vietnam War it was seen as a failure they threw them on the street we have a homeless problem all sorts of issues it's notorious that there's a popular correlation in the the kind of narrative public mindset about that that relationship between Veterans of the Vietnam War and so what we're talking about here is in groups and out groups always experience failure differently and it's their capacity to trick everybody into believing it that makes the binary function so here's an example this is from the report this is in Canadian military colleges Arbor report saying uh female Cadets were often told by their male peers that they were never going to be as good as them even when they were demonstratively so I don't know what to do with that information we can use the gender binary there facing the data and they're like we're still better than you so it's delusional right it's gender is of kind of delusion many resented having to trade in these groups clearly because if the female Cadets are doing as well as the male Cadets and they're still being told they're doing less well because they were demeaned at the slightest sign of difficulty or failure the dominant group though those who are identifying as men got to tell those who weren't identifying as the let's be clear these are the white men um that and let's they're bilingual white man because Quebec and and um uh Ontario is the dominant place where these groups came from the slightest difficulty failure the same is true for LGBT no that should be G that was my voice to speech kibets Cadets as the environment is prone to attribute and devalue some traits and celebrate the hypomasculine culture so what are we doing here masculinity then is a distortion of the dominant group to say that their attributes are better even when they're demonstratively not now the messed up part and this is what the arbor report function zone is that this produces culture this is a cultural problem this continues to cause major problems throughout the CAF the Canadian Armed Forces the staff of the athletic Wing were aware of these issues expressed concern and frustration at their inability to do more to address the problems so Educators in charge of military which you would assume is hierarchical where you could demand certain actions weren't able to address these deep-seated Notions about um about gender that they don't make sense so they can be a binary but they don't make sense bodies resist them they're not sensible even to those people experiencing them in real time and so the binary is just a story it denies it delegitimates and conceals the rights of people don't conform to it we have all of these different bills that try to say that this is is um that we can protect these rights they're constantly fought against there's stonewalling on gender identity and expression rights up to in the last this is the last decade this is your time um uh Canada tends to be deeply conservative in relation to sex sexuality and gender identity um this idea and we'll talk about this um of the personal being political but only in the public realm so we'll come back to this again and that the epistemology of the closet and this is the key Insight of of this is that the rational liberal male Western individual believes they choose the problem is and the key point the key critique of the epistemology of the closet is that when they are in the closet they believe that they are the identity that they're identifying with and when they're out of the closet they believe that that whole time that other person was wrong and then when they go back in the closet for whatever reason they believe that other person was wrong bodies are inconsistent in terms of their gender identity their sexuality and what they do even within the same meat Sac that we call a body and so this idea then of being morally panicked about about issues is that it's not the case so Chris moiser is a specific Advocate a competitive triathlete has been an Olympian and there is no moral Panic around Chris Mosier because it doesn't in any way challenge patriarchy because it's a trans man um and we get all the panic in the world um when it's trans women and so it's just not morally consistent and so the idea here of the the gender binary remaining powerful sure the textbook can say that I'm just not convinced um this remember the idea here is that there's more diversity but formal politics remains male cisgendered and heteronormative 100 look look here um the ways I express my gender identity it reinforces these things um the cisgender though is you from the Latin just means this side of which is the opposed to trans so with cisgender we're creating another binary right um across trans just means across from the other side of it means transition all the rest of it right um and so the key part then is the heteronormative part and this is what we're going to deal with over and over again is the normative back to the normative gender is normative sexuality is normative but bodies resist normativity um and so the problem here you know the 2021 election we have 30 percent of seats won by women and that's not great considering it's at least 50 of society in terms of equity but we also have in 2021 we've finally banned conversion theraport so this is not race this is not like a long-standing part this is very current stuff um and then we have eight MPS who are out and we have a two-spirit MP but the idea then that these are represent these representatives are representing our society is is not adequate to deal with the issues that we're facing in terms of this normativity um and so it comes back to these ideas about what representation we want how should representation happen and what does representation look like which is all about the internalization of institutional norms so it's not just that people will identify with whatever they identify with or they choose their identity no we we identify all the time with stuff that we barely know we're choosing we're not transparent to ourselves um and so we reproduce these these binary Norms these narratives but we have all sorts of examples of the ways in which this um is is internalized gender Norms are internalized they're not objective per se there are interpenetration of the objective and the subjective that produces weird outcomes the internalization of white supremacy misogyny and heteropatriarchy produces things like white women electing Trump right Trump has a casual attitude towards sexual assault gender-based violence could argue misogyny was part of his platform um 53 of white women elect Trump so they've identified in them either that race Trump's gender or that they would rather trust his going back his populism more so than perhaps their own identity right and so feminism is more than women it expresses this this claim for justice that that can or cannot be acknowledged and it involves people choosing their own oppressions right they do we could talk about maybe we'll talk about this idea of everybody's moms being into Fifty Shades of Gray there a couple years ago and the movies and the books and and just what are we doing like what's going on and so the internalization of Oppression produces the oppressor in all of us and we we are going to be doing it the question is we need to establish the buttress we have to buttress the rights against the ways in which we're going to choose normativity that's going to cause harm to ourselves and others that it's going to set standards so that we can be so delusional that we say that people aren't meeting the standards that we're not meeting them there are right that that level of delusion is part of how we think about gender
 so I mean the binary becomes this weird kind of Trope for thinking about this chapter um sure we can argue transgender and queer people's rights beyond the binary or we could just argue people's rights um we need to articulate the claims but we need to have this problem of this chapter being okay right like this is it and and we don't and I've got examples of this like uh I'll just record for the glossary um it's the comedian I forgot her name uh she's got a bunch of slasher anyways she just says look it you want to look at who um the bulk of people who are doing forms of mass shootings in the states men why don't we restrict their rights to guns Just men's rights to guns so then everybody has those rights to guns we just restrict them on men and this idea then of targeting groups because of their association with something is is this idea of specifically this privilege right the privilege faced so there are all sorts of barriers that formal politics create both tacitly explicitly and then in moral Panic against communities that have faced this forever in the cases two-spirit individuals that face this as long as settlement has been going on um and so they become the target for discriminatory policies and laws by federal and provincial government so just the removal of Rights right there I mean the simple one is is the partnership rights or rights rights to reproduce to adopt to get benefits survivor benefits grieve um have access to pensions basic things right like basic things about people that we partner with or relationships that we establish um and so we have all sorts of laws that are vaguely about these Notions about um what type of Acts are acceptable but they don't even make a ton of sense um as I was talking about before because people engage in stuff all the time all over the place that you know there was a proliferation there and specifically in the states of lawmakers who were passing these types of of uh laws were persistently getting caught engaging in the very thing they're passing laws against right um but there is a very clear and established well-established historical harm specifically around federal jobs for um any members of the lgbtq community there are some weird ways in which that produces any efforts to regulate bodies in this way is going to produce all sorts of weird outcomes that aren't logically consistent or don't even make sense right um denial of marriage and spousal benefits the ability to adopt children or you know donate blood because that one was an issue up to um I think it was 2022 I I was having to have um uh members of parliament come into my class and we would say to them what's going on here um and they're just it's just these ways in which these institutional decisions get carried over and people don't want to be the ones seen dismantling the institution because it costs something politically and so rights are all bound up in what decision was made in the past even it was a dumb decision because in the present we don't want to use the social capital the resources in order to change those decisions there is also an absence of intercept intersex discussion here a little bit earlier I'll put it in the glossary of the Oprah video I reference all the time just talking about the ways in which gender is oppressive um and this like just this idea of like just people have to use the social Factory going to the washroom just just keep your nose out of other people's business like it's it's not that hard but this goes back to Rawls and this idea of Tolerance like what kind what does tolerate mean right what does liberal tolerance mean we have to establish a better basis for establishing social normativity or the lack of thinking about how dominant groups are always going to say you can't do that because you're not this right um and so we have the underrepresentation of let's say all of these communities that we're talking about in electoral publics but but women in particular we can we can Target it as a large lump group um in types of the electoral system I worked on the Ontario campaign to push for proportional representation back and then when was that well early 2000s uh some of my YouTube videos are still out there I just designed the videos I didn't wasn't in them or anything um proportional representation so over certain groups of society should get automatic seats you get to put forward who gets those automatic seats but they should do that we've got those we've got lots of experiments with proportional representation and throughout the world hit and miss it's still representation uh hostile uh public opinion towards modern politics in the glossary you talk about this the male gaze and the ways in which these ideas are reproduced in in Us in each other and then even the expectation of leadership right so gendered Notions of leadership reproduce in women what a leader looks like and then When leaders don't look like that or they don't look in the way that we expect from leaders then we say that they're not legitimate their leadership isn't legitimate um we have bias and sexist media coverage of of let's be clear men and women candidates because then we try to reproduce these these Norms um parties as Gatekeepers absolutely that's what a political party is right it's supposed to organize and solidify a coherent strategy for electoral politics but you'll deal with that in the next term Politics as an old boys club um was all Elite societies all forms of professional organizations back to the discussion where mental hygiene mental health history it was about this idea of expertise and that expertise is the boundary between the in-group and the out group one of the most dominative groups is is these old boys clubs right um stereotypes of of let's be clear people as emotional and irrational so that men get characterized in this way too if they're excessively emotional in ways that isn't understood in this kind of this this aggressive culture in Canadian politics this is what Cynthia Weber calls both conscious and unconscious ideologies we talk about consciousness ideologies all the time but gender ideologies tend to be unconscious ideologies because we participate them in our social Factory right the ways in which we produce so so even things like conservatism produces this idea of a classless society as it is advocated by certain classes of study English people are white everyone and I know is straight are ways in which they do this um this is why like they're not even stereotypes they're kind of delusions because we don't have any evidence of this what we do is we we cherry pick the evidence um that reinforces the ways in which we think these things and so rationality emotions are framed as as advanced civilized and rational I don't have a ton of evidence of populists being rational or well reasonable um what we do is we we pray we paint with broad brushes and we hope that that covers enough to be explanatory without being accurate right and the ways in which we produce indigenous peoples as the as the opposite this goes back to zootopia right so you can be civilized or uncivilized and if you're um emotional or unreasonable you're seen as as dangerous but as if you're civilized non-civilized you're you're outside the bounds um white women as emotional and passive black women um as emotional angry the tropes there's a whole bunch of tropes angry black women there's a Trope that's deployed all over the place the regulation of emotion is a Kia aspect here we're talking a hush child has done tons of work on this the ways in which we regulate emotion societies decide which emotions are okay or Howard Dean Yeehaw famously him doing a Yeehaw got him kicked out of the presidential race he was seen as as unelectable after that and so the idea then is that anger privilege is is really just reserved for already privileged groups groups that are already privileged and can rile up that anger in others um let's be clear I mean advertising driven social media pays for the most outlandish and extreme examples it's why flat earthing can be a thing because everybody thinks it's funny until everybody is is dealing with it in a semi-ironic way and then they're dealing with it they forgot about the irony and then they're fully believing the amplification of extremes is built in to the lack of a mainstream media mainstream media I don't know if there ever was a mainstream media but what we would call Mainstream media produced a liberal consensus about this is what we should watch it was much easier when there was three channels on TV where everybody watched the same thing the proliferation of the internet and advertising driven media has resulted in these Echo Chambers these rabbit holes these places in which we don't interact with other ideas and so we create these feedback loops of delusion right and how we do these things and so um uh politics and Society I would say remains hostile aggressive towards women and racialized people that just I mean whatever the hell Twitter is now is yes and so it amplifies and can amplify those spaces and make them more important than they would be for for people um and the ways in which we remember and don't remember people and the history that we create for people and so AOC is targeted so Alexandria um okay Cortez AOC um is look at me just white up at me um is framed in the textbook as this example um but I I think we probably need to be a little more critical about the ways in which it's deployed and not deployed at certain points in time I you know a sitting president or presidential candidate mocking somebody with a disability isn't disqualifying but um you know showing the wrong emotion is tripping on a bicycle I I don't know um it's it's weird how we do these things I we want to lump them in in order to have a clear explanatory framework because we know that gender normativity exists I just think that if we look too closely it starts falling apart
 so this is uh slides in a part of the chapter that I'm very in aligned with because of my biases um just the idea of thinking about where politics occurs and what is political I I always like that reset I think it's an important reset to do so the sexual contract dividing the society into public and private spheres again framed as an oppositional gender binary it's probably more complex than that women relegated to the private sphere private sphere is seen as natural corporeal emotional and the public sphere is where politics occurs man-made intellectual rational we've talked about this before so some of that comes into it here there are other ways in which this is framed the state then especially in the Monarch the Monarch is framed as a singular individual this also came up in our discussion of fascism in the body this idea of a singular body that the nation-state is as you know relations are envisioned as conflict or cooperation as as framed in terms of um you know hyper masculine male rational reason strategy games I think there's an Always Sunny episode about diplomacy when they're trying to escape from a escape room um and then the idea of the social ethics of care or things like the icrc the Red Cross is framed as as less than diplomatic or in the other space or like caring about bodies is distinct from from you know real political issues we also have violations as as ideas of penetration or violations as as violence so if you you know how dare you fly your plane into my territory is seen as violence stuff like that and then individuals are largely and this is the problem with the current International System we're stuck at 192 and then we got you know 4 000 languages or 4 000 groups um we we have individuals as non-reproductive so they we don't have a good way to do Pregnancy two-state Solutions stuff like that um all we do is create new ones and we don't really like the new States always come at the loss of an old we have a singular monovocal vision of how we think about this um and that so we've got ways in which gendered colonial normativity is embedded in the very core of of what is political and the Erasure of history and past and the reproduction of of things in which this has happened and so I just like these memes because they represent this Erasure of the kind of archetypes of masculinity and heroism and militarism um you know an excuse historical accuracies but I draw the line at Achilles being um straight in in Troy in 2004 played by um uh Brad Pitt right um and that this post was flagged because there might be adult content because they're showing the friendship as history characterized it between Achilles and uh Patrick I'm butchering that um what do you mean this is adult content it's completely platonic male bonding this is sappho and her friend um you know Alexander the Great refuses to eat cries in bed for weeks holds one of the most expensive funerals in the ancient world to his honor and then dies within eight months of losing him historians are they friends this constant Erasure right this Erasure because the public is supposed to be public and the private is supposed to be private um and so the private sphere is supposed to be apolitical but it never has been that's the whole premise of the the feminist preposition the personal is political the Spheres are not separate they constantly overlap and it's largely a fiction that we maintain in order to have domain expertise right and we established domain expertise who takes out the garbage right if we establish that whose problem is the garbage garbage is a municipal issue well global climate change would say that garbage is a global issue now right that we have to think about these things and so private relationships are inherently political um you know you can think of it this way like which relationships should get tax benefits and which one should those type of things so which ones establish the foundation of making claims and which ones don't um who who gets this and so these relationships are integral part to political life um identity is an intermediation of the institutional and personal it's this ability of of me to demand excuse me meet to demand entitlements and the state to respond to that Demand right whose demand it responds to um and the ways in which we erase Concepts and identities in its ourselves so this meme talking about this girl is we shouldn't allow them to get married because then all the girls would want to marry a girl in population would die out because we all want to marry girls right right and the ways in which we don't even know the ways in which we're involved in our own oppression and so um political work is often carried out through private channels um politics occurs in a formal and informal private ways I've done dealt with this for a long time I've never figured out a good way to write a course outline because a course outline wants an explicit legal document is really what it's doing right it's not for you or me it is when we get in disputes it's a contract dispute settlement right that's what the course outline is um and so the course outline then is there so that others when they have to come in and mediate the dispute between you and me about how you got your grade they have the document to refer to but that curriculum is just a public curriculum and so when we get to ableism um next class we'll talk about this about the ways in which the formal establishment of Law's rules and orders are always backed up by an informal curriculum which is the idiosyncratic scripted interpersonal Communications the ways that we learn when we talk to one another which is why online learning doesn't work it's okay for lectures it's not great for the interpersonal the ways in which we we learn and understand particularly in the condensed period when you are you know in your 20s and 30s it's particularly useful can be less useful labor it I don't know there's all sorts of gender normativity there's also a hidden curriculum which is unintentional and interpersonal it's structural things it's the Western bubble it's the ways in which Norms are produced it's the must-knows at uwo Facebook group it's the ways in which like things are produced and reproduced and that must knows place now all the institutional actors look at it so it becomes this other thing so everybody DMS right to get around that and so there's also things that are not included and so this textbook the reason we're using this textbook is because it's finally including a whole bunch of these things that we've never had included before and then there's also ways in which everybody kind of circulates knowledge and ideas so don't use reading notes from previous years because this is a new course and they won't help you and so those ideas of the Shadow archive that the pedagogy that's outside of how we think or or the ways in which we try to teach something but we inadvertently teach the others is the way that the political goals are always carried out in different ways indigenous black and racialized women have sought alternative means of doing politics they always have they've always done politics they've just done it differently it's why our leadership literature is so bad because it looks at existing leaders and or and then tries to figure out what's the problem with leadership and it can't because it's not actually looking at leadership it's looking at a very specific narrow conception of Who's involved in gender normativity and Leadership and what those models are so we have to look elsewhere we have to look at the black women's Collective and I don't know more as examples of this so this is from uh the the our textbook just the idea that these spaces that spheres of influence created and sustained by African-American women are not solely meant as a respite but it's where they establish political sanctuaries they're nurtured they established leadership they come to the the benefit the creative power of the community conceptualization of Family Church all of those things come together and are framed in different ways and empowered and those uh are a source of support when when people experience and black women a particular experience race gender and class oppression and so the idea here is that we have to think about the ways in which we are producing kind of are we talking about formal politics informal politics hidden politics what we're not doing no politics which is often this ignorance and then the ways in which we learn vicariously from one another um this for example this idea that we have always had people around us is this the extent to which we don't recognize the ways in which they participate in things like being housemates for 45 years and so the government then tries to come in the formal system tries to come in to regulate all those other systems and it does about as good a job as you could expect right um these efforts to regulate individual bodies and sexual activities good luck it's largely a fiction that isn't deployed uniformly and any coherent way it's deployed by hierarchical positions of authority in situations where we want to Target minority communities for whatever reason and so we have changes in the criminal code but those changes Trudeau's famous changes only make private gay sex acceptable I think it was in this reading one of the reasons that we had um that in 1969 there's legal court case because of washrooms and Montreal where paywatch and men were having sex with men in them and they tried to say well you're using a public space and they said well no because we paid for this space it's equivalent of a hotel room it's one of the reasons we probably don't have to pay washrooms anymore because public private um and so we have you know 69 we have these but then we have things like 1981 operations so soap this rating of bath houses uh the persistent criminalization of sex work I will say that bath houses exist all over the world and things happen in them all over the world um but we don't ever talk about it or we we talk about it informally um but there's all sorts of stuff that happens in all sorts of places um and that what that means is up to the people engaged in it I don't know what that means so what we're talking about here is that the ways in which these this sexual citizenship then embody citizenship with the deployment of Rights and responsibilities that come with being part of dominant or non-dominant forms of sexuality um the the emergence of two-spirit and lgbtq social movements is the the organization of their political power their channeling of resources in order to try to make dominant groups recognize the ways in which their normalization is causing harm right uh challenging these hetero patriarchal Norms the denial of rights and protections and the demand for certain rights the just the constant Erasure in the normalization this idea of this euphemism of greeting a fan after a victory like that that's a fan and so private spaces are inherently political these are the battles on the streets um the private spaces are constantly telling us things that we just choose to ignore um the problem of course is that framing everything through through certain types of hetero patriarchal regulation expanding the rights to to marriage to others is seen as successful goal but this is just largely in institutions that has been used to excuse exclude regulate and punish marginalized contact it doesn't change the underlying contract in any way um and that ways in which like these experiences are just constantly erased both in terms of who's telling the story how they're telling the story and what those stories are being told is part of the problem of the heteropatriarchal contract
 so in the last video we talked about the kind of three dominant critiques and I want to spend a bit more time about the specifics in um the social reproduction critique of the public private because the public and private split has never really existed um social reproduction is the ways in which the private sphere is needed to reproduce um future workers and citizens women's work is vital to sustaining the economy but it's often undervalued and unpaid the easiest way is Child Care Child Care you know if you have to go and pay for somebody else to do it you know exactly how much it's worth but when you do it at home you're not compensated for it and so racially um historically racialized women had no choice but to work for others we still have all sorts of well get into this with citizenship when we get to it um we still use visas and deployment of citizenship and the recruitment of of women as a targeted group a intersectional women from around the world 2 do forms of care care work domestic work and then we could talk about trafficking and sexual sex work as well but the idea of domestic work as being a primary impetus of mechanisms of migration of strategies of visa and strategies of citizenship and so this is still the case if you look at Elder Care the ways in which we target certain communities and in very specific ways to allow them access to those forms of employment but not necessarily access to full citizenship and so that's a ways in which we deploy social reproduction as a strategy and so social reproduction is just a whole bunch of thing one how we reproduce mailpreg I really I wonder and this the question I will pose like you know for presenting men how many of you would choose to carry a child to term if you could right we tend to think about these things in binary ways but you know we've got technology we've got all sorts of technology in vitro fertilization development of Technology reproductive Technologies the artificial uterus this idea that we can we could why not right why not do these things and then see how the questions change and see how the the reproduction changes um hopefully we'll get to some discussions and menstruation later too and how the kind of politics of that are all built into this um and so the reproduction of the labor force requires substance Education and Training and then we decide who gets paid and who does what so um if we do it in this very specific ways we decide who um who the reproduction and provisioning of carrying happens and then the extent to which it's a public or private issue and so the easiest examples of this are we have all sorts of different models of social reproduction um you know these kind of old western biblical traditions of patriarchal households trade and agriculture and then using unpaid labor or literal slave labor as forms of social reproduction right feudal we have the familiar label for the Lord taxation substance but like both familiar labor for the feudal was both men and women and the kids everybody was involved in the Victorian we get the scientific reproduction of gendered Labor so as I talk about in the glossary we take things like Midwifery and we take it away from women's and we force them into the house and we say that that medicine and science has control over reproductive work and that we should make decisions not good decisions just make decisions mercantilism Imperial Conquest fortism we reproduce a special post-war this idea of assembly lines and this kind of re this this work that requires unpaid women's work specifically the post-war taking women who worked at assembly lines and then coming up with all these systems why they're supposed to go back to unpaid work when they were working on assembly lines during the war um but we do things like public schooling State capacity so we expand social benefits social welfare and then we have all sorts of ways in which we allow corporations to provide or not provide those forms of work and then we get the post-war nuclear family this idea of of you know women in the home males having an income that allows them to sustain the entire family with female unpaid home labor that's a regulatory of uh notion of this and then we can talk about this kind of post nuclear family what we have now is that people assemble and that we're moving back to intergenerational families because housing is so expensive and so when we think about private sphere as being political about social reproduction um the state is absolutely always concerned with social reproduction it's concerned with this it's why we do the census it's why we do this so we can establish policies that encourage or discourage forms of social reproduction we like or don't like want or don't want see is valuable or not um so the idea of the ways in which we change um social reproduction is how we societally establish how long and how far apart people should have uh children the time between these the length of pregnancy in terms of what is the social conception of how like this um uh paternity maternity or parental leave is a notion of how long care should take right and so if you go on Parental leave for a specific amount of time the state regulates in the the states is three days or something or if your company regulates it's two months that's a form of regulating how much time you get to spend and how much you get to take in terms of pregnancy um and then it how we regulate those things and how the state is involved with it and you know in the Scandinavian countries you get five thousand dollars when you get pregnant you get all this these uh these things the in the French system you know you can have In-Home Care all the ways in which we produce or encourage or discourage pregnancy um also things like fetal mortality which shutting down things like access to reproductive capabilities which has been happening in the states as a direct correlation of the decreasing rates of of um maternal and Fetal mortality for marginalized communities in the U.S we've seen it we've seen this study even under Trump we've seen it shoot up that areas where we shut down Planned Parenthood result in all sorts of other health complications that don't have to do with direct access to Reproductive Rights they have everything to do with the broader framework of of health and reproduction and then their presence or absence of birth control has all sorts of ways in which we do this and so the length of time can be adjusted by cultural factors how when you wean children and cultural taboos over sex and breastfeeding what's the normal length of time and so this is Time Magazine kind of doing some of this stuff that's her three-year-old what's the length this is these type of cultural norms become ones that we regulate and talk about and think about as cultural attitudes just breastfeeding and the ways in which Nestle has a gross history of targeting communities specifically black communities with free formula when the kids are first born as ways to make sure that they can't breastfeed and they get become dependent on forms of Revenue and wealth and so all of these cultural Notions are Reaper uh about reproductive ages have changed how migration male migration or female migration changes the the country that has the migration happen or doesn't happen not all migrating populations have high birth rates for whatever reason the French Canadian birth rates after settlement dropped dramatically so that almost 8 million French Canadians are are descended from 1400 women so communities within communities can be the source of the reproduction of that Society or not and then we could have the broader question about settler societies and birth rates about in what ways or birth rates forms of social reproduction and social settlement right um social reproduction is also economic issue um if the cost of raising children is low you'll generally tend to have more but if it's more expensive you'll have less we we have lots of evidence of this this is happening in in South Korea in the U.S and Canada um in recessions or when cost of living is to a high birth rate struck and that Social Security both children as a value of Social Security and as the absence of it so if your state has Social Security you don't need to have children in order to have somebody to care of you when you're older they don't have it you do and so there's cultural religious factors that all comes into this and it's the wealth flows theory that social reproduction happens when Society is doing well and when it's not people will minimize their family size and so we have these ways in which the family is intimately connected to social regulation to participation about who participates in this hetero patriarchal uh framing of the social contract the state has all sorts of ways it can intervene encourage or discourage forms of these things happening having non-um having um not having minimum wages that allow you to live by yourself having the livable wages that allow you to to live by yourself the capacity of Social Security to make things cheap the cultural and social attitudes towards reproduction states can adopt all sorts of attitudes but if society and culture rejects it it won't happen and so gender Dynamics are are intimately linked to social reproduction and the status of women is directly linked to fertility and population growth the capacity to um to deal with unwanted pregnancies the likelihood of maternal death all of those things factor into the choices made around social reproduction um yeah these are just more examples of the Erasure of the ways in which people choose to live or not live in the ways in which society says they should or shouldn't live um and so the private sphere is always political who gives care how they give care and how they're remunerated for their care is deeply political and so we remained it in this sexual contract gender normativity around these kind of gender polls matters exclusion is still rampant and will remain so because we are all implicated in forms of normativity and claims for justice about whether we're conscious of them or not and that Consciousness itself represents the ability to challenge gender normativity because if you don't even know what you're challenging you're not going to be able to challenge
 okay everyone welcome to the discussion of gender and genders and sexuality um you know this is I've been arguing throughout the course so far that um I where is this where is it where is it why isn't it been here what's going on why why don't we have this more um I the textbook is doing a couple things that I want to talk about I'm doing a couple things that we want to talk about um this is one of those weird discussions of identity that that becomes both static and Abstract that needs a grounding over and over again um and so I've got a lot of memes in here and I'm doing a glossary again only because I don't know like I don't know what people's level of comfort is with these ideas they're changing all the time I go back and look at my lectures from a couple years ago they've changed the language has changed what I can borrow has changed how we think about these things stuff changes and so that's just how it is um you know I used to not get this and then I kind of got this and then I didn't think it was good and then now I actually think I kind of agree with this um in a weird way and so I'm not sure that we'll all get the same logic in that the idea of of having a space that the social facticity of of identity right people need to perform bodily functions and is society going to allow them to do so seems like a pretty basic thing that you shouldn't need a lot of politics to figure out but increasingly these are deeply political issues and so we're talking about what we're going to do today um this is is the structure of the textbook and I'm going to kind of put my own stuff on it I think that's the value added right and it's your value attitude you have to figure out what you want to accept and what you want to reject and what your commitments are and what they are like I can't try to indoctrinate you on this stuff and I'm not interested in doing that I'm interested in articulating what the textbook's saying kind of some of the things that I think and I'm research and then you have to figure out what it is that you understand from this stuff and so in the abstract the textbook is doing this move in the abstract to try to make it as abstract as possible I think to avoid the kind of the personal is political which seems counterintuitive anyways so we're going to talk about the Canadian State the ways in which the Canadian state is implicated in this in what the textbook calls this hetero patriarchal which I'll unpack I mean it's not even a concept that you know I'm quite comfortable with gender Concepts my dissertation and my PhD dealt with masculinities and gender it's not that it's just that the terminology is weird sometimes terminology changes and it brings in new stuff and doesn't so we'll talk about challenges to the binary division of the public uh and the political and the private and the domestic which I think it's a Perpetual issue when I teach international law it's a massive issue just about like the role of the state and when we're talking about Warfare and then what what takes place on the battlefield and what's a violation of of Law and rule of law and rights and all of those things they're all bound up in this um we'll certainly talk about feminist queer racialized indigenous Advocates have have resisted these types of discriminations and then how you would apply these approaches and I I don't think I can think of myself without applying these approaches that that men in masculinities um you know settler attitudes my sense of self are all bound up in what others think and how they think about those things um stuff like this right the ways in which we can do this I do think there is a need to to think concretely um think through these ideas and think through the joking saying what can't be said and what a joke kind of adequately does and so when we think about these things there's a there's a bunch of um these questions it's weird because these questions I I you know I'm going through the textbook the same way you are each chapter is is new to me each chapter has different authors in case you haven't noticed so sometimes the authors repeat each other and there's a little bit of tension between the chapters too so some of these questions you know what is political that's what we've been asking since the beginning and you have to have some sense of what that is you should have some sense of what that is just in your own in order to make sense of the world around us right who's allowed to participate who's allowed to speak and and what do they represent when they speak um where does politics occur and then who deserves rights and then how are rights achieved I would guess we would say because I don't like the idea of granting rights and I don't I do like the idea of taking rights but they have to be taken from something or from some system of adjudication and so these have been clearly persistent themes of these interventions but it is weird that we haven't talked about this stuff kind of substantively when we're thinking about this I've tried to do that throughout um the identities in chapters six through ten that's the focus of all these different things so we're going to deal with with ableism and and um we're we've already dealt with indigeneity and we're dealing with uh we dealt with race and now we're dealing with gender and so we'll go through these as we go how to think about this um so to make it clear everybody has their own biases these are my biases they don't mean I can't judge things and that I can't recognize that my biases influence my analysis what we do when we foreground our biases is say this is how we come to things so if you're trying to figure out why it is that I'm saying what I'm saying it's because of these now there's going to be ways which I can't foresee that this is happening but this there's something one I just think gender is oppressive and Regulatory to bodies in the glossary we'll have this discussion I've been showing an Oprah clip a very old Oprah clip for a very long time um just talking about intersex bodies in the way in which gender gender Norms try to reshape those bodies in a literal medical sense with with surgery into types of gender normativity and they just resist it um we resist this on every level we can get into this I've written about this in sport and the ioc in the past in the ways in which bodies once we start to dig into to what barteries are we try to do type things like chromosomes and we try to deal with gametes and stuff like this it gets really messy really quick which is to say that gender is also a limitation of technology and design I don't know if it's appropriate or not but certainly with the Advent of of augmented reality it's easier than ever for people for me if I put a filter onto switch gender identification um only online so if we're able to take that into our personal lives how does that happen and I've got some clips again in the glossary dealing with this in relation to to botched into two spirit identities and the idea that people can people have and always have move between genders had different understandings of gender and a lot of that has to do with how we are capable of fulfilling their societal needs in our current societal makeup which is a technology and design function like bodies queer is an inherently anti-normative concept it doesn't have a set meaning it's resistant to Norms and as a consequence of that then it reflects this idea and this goes back this little old old idea of the idea that bodies are polymorphously perverse which is they don't tell us anything about how we enjoy or desire those things are always constructed in this inter-subjective relationship between how I feel and what I'm capable of feeling it and and whether or not that Society can even provide the the space for me to feel those ways and so um we're thinking about this um you know identities only make sense in the practice like the subreddit needs to be there in order to understand kind of contemporary manifestations of white subtle male North American identity um not entirely not exhaustively and not completely in its oppressive to somebody's to frame it that way but it's also reflects a certain normativity that comes out in that normativity is something we can constantly resist but we constantly do right the oppressor and all of us um there is an interesting sleight of hand trick in this chapter which I don't disagree with I just don't know if they should if you should have to make your method explicit and so in this case the method is we aren't going to discuss identity we're going to talk about rights and so the right space model is okay they problematize this near the end of the chapter as if somehow Liberation is the same as like marriage rights which for many communities it doesn't even make sense right that's not a sensible way to thing frame things so what we what we do then is we just assume all these identities exist and we assume that everybody understands what they are which is okay but it's a bit of um I don't know what do you call the liberal elitism assuming that because I know something you should know it too I I don't think that's true I think people are everybody's capable of understanding these things but I'm not sure that assuming everybody knows these things isn't a way that'll make people feel dumb right if you don't know what what you're talking about and so framing these issues in terms of Rights then is just saying well why doesn't this group have these rights yet but for some people they might not have an experience with that group and might not understand what it is or how those rights are being articulated or what they look like right um so so this is a bit of an inherently Fabian framing we want to achieve these rights for these communities so we're just going to assume everybody knows who those communities are and what they're arguing for and now we'll just talk about the right space Framing and so weirdly in this chapter we're talking about all these identities we never really get a sense of who is speaking or why they're speaking and so we talk about lots of important identities Throughout the chapter but we don't really talk about the I guess we kind of talk about the way they're impressed they're oppressed but we don't have any subjects doing the oppression or if we do we're being very late about it because we don't want to offend anybody um and so this is what I I don't have any sense I don't you know I have to pre-record these lectures and then we'll do it in person and while I have to gauge it it's feedback right there's there's only one way we'll talk about this but the ways that the the um the shadow archive or what we talk the hidden curriculum right the hidden curriculum is a thing that we can talk about the ways in which kind of social attitudes get conveyed in the way that we don't say things and the ways in which we assume other people uh understand things so that's why I put the glossary in I don't know who the glossary is for I'm not sure what the glossary is doing I've got a video in a minute that talks about the problems of definitions so this isn't a dictionary definition and these aren't I don't provide definitions that you should memorize what I'm doing is providing a provocation an example a tick tock that provides an example which then I try to back up with some type of academic literature I actually thought I should be showing you how I find them it's Google Scholar and then it's keyword variation until they get something that approximates the argument that's taking place in the video or supports it or estab publishes its foundation in academic literature um and so you know how do we think about this and then how do we think about it and this will be a kind of central question about homo and heterosocial organization the ways in which kind of Western thought creates binaries and then it frames everything in oppositions um the other thing that will come out through here is is the hidden right the what is Cedric calls the epistemology of the closet the idea that that certain groups can't see and that people aren't even transparent to themselves let's be clear people are trans be transparent to themselves because it requires them to understand themselves in ways in which they don't um so there's a lot of denial I've got a whole bunch of memes in here about just um uh sexual Erasure so dominant groups just erase the existence of other groups in real time and so this is an example of that I'm sure I'm bisexual uh Marnie Simpson I have no idea who these people are it doesn't matter um hence hints at sexuality she's sure they say hints after admitting she kisses more girls than boys and then the sub might think she's like it's the obviously tweeting something they're sure about but then the community they're receiving Community says well we're not sure about that um which is all about normativity and so this is the often used example but it's interesting to think about about um how the example always is is that left-handed there's some left-handed people have always exist but societies when they're trying to mass educate and the history of most of these societies has been to design to think and to exist as if everyone is right-handed now some of those societies have taken up this cause and tried to rethink how we think about normativity and design and outcomes this does cause like injuries and death as a relationship of not being able to reach the thing quick enough or respond to the situation quick enough um but it's this idea that um I don't know if Lefty Frets is a good source of data for statistica to use but sure whatever it's just the this idea that if this is happening with regularity if it happens with a human regularity whatever the hell human means um why is it so different based on the community in which you're in and why are there places we would assume that are more conscious of more understanding of difference that are able to accommodate the difference and then what's happening in places with strong authoritarian systems where they don't right or they don't think about this difference that's really what we're talking about here this is the one that's used all the time that's the Washington Post just the history of left-handedness from 1880 to 1900 to 1920 and then it stabilizes so that is to say and this is the whole point of a lot of these discussions is statistically we could be at a period where there's going to be a certain regularity and with two-spirit we know that people have had non-stable gender identities before Western Civilization could be called civilization and so as a consequence of that then that means that we probably had a level of gender identity whatever you want to call people existing and then Society tries to minimize those number of people existing and then we decide at some point well we'll try to change our social norms so that we allow and then it stabilizes and so this question of of what is a norm and who creates norms and what Norms means the Assumption here is that there's always going to be a certain level I don't know that that's the case but we can assume that this is just the idea of um how we have as a society reinforced patterns of behavior breeding food all the rest of it to produce different types of bodies over time in the bodies of chickens because we want to eat them billions of them a year remember 70 billion I think we need two chickens for every person on the planet anyways um and so this idea too would be more than that anyways um the idea here that that what is normal is always going to be socially constructed and it's not going to be the same over time and so the idea of normalcy or the constitution of what a problem requires a society to exist and so we don't really have a sense of normalcy until mathematicians get obsessed with the idea of a distribution of gaussian distribution a curve the bell curve and that that is supposed to be the ideal again because you know in political science we're obsessed with ideals I guess there's some type of platonic ideal or in this case an analytical ideal something we can mathematically Force bodies into as if forcing those bodies into produces this and then Notions of this and this we've been dealing with this all along the idea of progress right do we think something is Progressive or not what does that mean what would it look like and so the whole idea of of this is as Queer as as anti-normative or non-normative is a as a framework that is intentionally ambivalent resisting a monolithic definition understanding your specific characterization of it identity took this from from Cedric in 1993 and referenced 15 000 times and so what we're trying to deal with here is I've been talking about how long is this intersectional kind of framing of feminist Theory how all of these come together the the idea of gender class and racial oppression in the construction is a hierarchy and power how gender and sexuality are differently constructed regulated on the basis of these identities um we'll come to these over and over again but the black and racialized women in the feminist movement who are rendered invisible Kimberly cramshaw who who was just a legal scholar coming up with the idea that if you were I talked about it before but if you were um black you would make claims as from the uh make a legal claim from a black community if you were women you make legal claims from a women Community but we had no framework to how you would make claims with both of those and the more that their overlapping forms of Oppression the harder it is to do these things and so where we come to understand gendered social learning I don't know I don't know where it happens I don't know where you think your gendered social learning happens I'm not sure how you think about Identity or how your identity is um formed about about is it something that comes from the home is it something that comes from socialization with friends is something that happens in the school is it something that happens in public is it private is gender is sexuality how are they how are they relation how are they reinforced how are they discouraged the social facticity of things and so that's this is the example I've got it in here um we'll talk about this just one of the ideas of social effect is if you have an idea of someone's job to take out the garbage right I think I've got it right here actually let me show it oh my goodness oh I didn't show it here I don't have it um anyways I I will pause here and then have to bring it back together so this is The Tick Tock that deals with um the social facticity of of this and so blue bins are a blue job the gender normativity of of how we do those questions should be dealt with by the people who have to deal with those questions and so this is one of those weird situations where it's not at all clear that that's the case um and that it's not at all clear how that normativity comes about or if that person just chooses to make that decision or if they make that decision because their parents did it they make the decision because they as a in a relationship have decided they as a in a couple have decided that one of them is going to do those jobs and then is going to assign them to some type of role as all forms of social factitity of gender and so when we think about these things this idea then that there if we're dealing with intersectionality we should be focusing on the ways in which intersectionality of gender is oppressive in ways that multiplies those oppressions in order to impede Justice right that under this that under patriarchy um the pervasiveness of intersectionality means that sexuality and gender are going to have a very specific way of simultaneous oppression that is neither racial nor solely sexual that's in 1974 right this idea and so the idea that these are new issues doesn't make any sense at all the idea that we'd have these debates today doesn't make any sense at all because these things have been happening for as long as things have been happening we can deal with this idea of of you know they deal with it specifically sexuality and gender in the Canadian context um there's a great book on this that I teach in my other classes on the Canadian war on queers which is the purging of lgbtq people from Canadian Public Service in the military throughout the Cold War and as they argue in the text it's not because the Americans require us to do it it's because we choose to do it as Canadians the Canadian nationality serves as the foundation of doing things like developing a fruit machine which you attach to genitals to see if they get a biophysical response from showing pornography to people as as if this is a real thing it's a it it's dystopian in it it's absurdity and so this idea of of the the politicians who have to come out and fight against being characterized as criminal because they are gay in the Canadian war and queer they famously talk about how the idea that there was this this decorated war hero um who uh we like embodied masculinity and just was in no way closeted and was strong and clear and a great uh military and he was still kicked out because he was gay because it was seen as somehow insufficient or not part of the body politic but he never hit it and he did nothing um to ever make it any reason for him to be kicked out of than it being his identity that's Trudeau senior there at a gay protest there's a link there if you want into the the history of this um and so part of the problem is that I think some of the debates that we have about gender and sexuality aren't based in data um so this we had this from the Census in 2021 the number of people I was trying to figure statistically this is insignificant right we're talking like point three percent of the Canadian population and not significant in any statistical way like even if you go City by city in Canada this is less than .08 percent of the population 75 percent of the Canadian population lives in these colored areas so in that club in that quarter in Southwestern Ontario and Quebec that little part around Calgary and that little green spot in Vancouver so statistically whatever happens there matters more than the rest of Canada just by sheer numbers so statistically this is totally insignificant people are really bad at assessing groups based on media so this is American estimates you can pull this up it's um I think this is yougov just talking about how how America Americans estimate so they estimate the number of the population with income over 1 million uh dollars they Americans think it's 20 it's not statistically it's it's less than one percent so it's zero um the the idea of trans or trans identity is 20 it's it's one like barely around one um our indigenous uh 27 it's it's one um live in New York City 30 it's three um the let's do our member of a union 35 percent it's four uh are vegan or vegetarian it's 30 it it's uh five um voted in the 2020 election that's one thing they got right 60 um and then all of these other things are are overestimated and underestimated right and so this is this issue when we're dealing with things like um uh the rights relating to these communities why they're being targeted um for regression so taking away rights or taking away the access the ability to access things is this this problem of numbers American adults are now choose that group to attack and I go back to what LBJ said a long time ago and he said if you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man he won't notice you're picking his pocket hell give him somebody to look down on and he'll empty his pockets for you only one and so that's very similar to what Dubois said this is another thing talking about statistics intersex is not an anomaly yet it only accounts for 1.7 percent of the population on the high end of this is a weird argument to me is me 0.0006 of the global population lives in Ireland but we all agree that people live in Ireland four percent of the population has green eyes but green is a natural eye color 1.5 percent of the population are redheads but red hair is a natural hair color but the 1.7 percent of intersex population is where you suddenly consider biology and deformity yeah let's all keep pretending that gender isn't a social construct the intersex is not and then this is just Bomani Jones talking about this this problem making something out of of literal statistical props at school from being a dude and saying that you are a girl so that you can go dominate at sports you're not even from that we have here is a group of people who have an argument that they get treated worse than anybody else in our society and definitely at the greatest risk of somebody killing you for no goddamn reason in this society and to gen up outrage toward those people we have manufactured an issue which is they want to come play sports and the problem just doesn't it the problem just simply doesn't exist right so I don't even go further beyond that point when it comes up is there's no there there in this I think it's in Kentucky where they passed a bill that applied to literally one person so passing bills that apply to one person is is nonsense so the reason that I have such a strong reaction to these these type of debates is because I've been through this because I took my degree and I was getting my degree when 9 11 happened and then we had to deal with what we've statistically studied now is the billions and billions of dollars put into stopping something that didn't effectively stop anything um in terms of this so this is a new form of moral Panic if you just look at the return on the investment like the amount put in versus the number of events that were prevented and so it's it's all framed in terms of these these weird metaphors all the time about this but but realistically this goes back and I talked about this before and I'll talk about it again um is the ways in which we frame uh the idea of using a speech act to securitize something so the idea here is that what we're actually securitizing is statistically not significant if you're passing a law for one person it undermines the idea that we're all the same under the law and it also undermines the idea that the law is impartial right and so what this really reflects then is a moral Panic it's these these ideas they're by Design you can do this and we've done this over and over again in political science we've dealt with the issues of terrorism how all of the stress tests and all the mechanisms that we put on the systems put in place to stop terrorism don't pass any threshold of Effectiveness they just don't um and so what happens then is that we just we pick up this idea of the you know what's the problem or how this is they're not randomly selected if we typically pick marginalized groups as cultural scapegoats even when the vast majority are Law Abiding and even when many of majority are not in in the dominant group we just tend to do this uh out of proportion with the actual threat um and then we just fight about whether the extent to which this is a risk we want to do risk there's great political science stuff done on insurance and risk uh we can go into that it's a very interesting topic this just doesn't have anything to do with that um it's not statistically significant
 so I should have included in the last discussion on language but the idea of terminology here does matter um we should be conscious of language in the way in which it's used so um as the textbook says in box 6.1 you know indigenous is a term that accompanies diverse Nations and peoples who have long-standing connections to territories um it really started in the 1970s and thinking about these contexts in specifically the UN drip Aboriginal is a term in the the constitution in 1982 and includes First Nations Inuit and metis First Nations refers to people or descendants of the original inhabitants of Canada um and then we've got the Inuit refers to specific groups of people living in the Arctic again it's such an amalgamation I'm not sure so this is what I'm saying when we're talking about language we're really talking top down when we're coming up with these terms now people have to use these terms in order to get recognition but it's not a useful like exercise in identity formation per se it's largely like the ways in which we navigate settler States so metis is people who are have have unions or or the product of relationships between um indigenous women fur Traders but really any any kind of relationship that develops over time not all people who have those relationships have metis status and and vice versa all of these questions come back to to issues relating specifically to the reason we still use the word Indian Act is because it's enshrined in a piece of legislation and the charter and then it re confers status and so status has been a long contentious issue a gendered issue an issue relating to the questions of democracy and how we can think about these things it's it's it's very complicated in part because it's all of these efforts of the state to make all of the different communities assimilate into a single category that they can be referenced to or or are controlled or modified um I mean I've got an article I don't know if I included it yet but I I can it's it's um indigenous peoples are migrants too for a period in the 60s and 70s the the federal government thought it was a good idea to try to treat indigenous groups as as immigrants because it saw the idea of assimilation that it was happening with with migrants from around the world as a strategy they could use to assimilate and so this assimilation issue has been the persistent issue it is what gives rise to um the UN drip it's this thing that takes decades to complete these settler States in particular participated in the process there's lots of documentation on this as strategies to obfuscate slow down um um challenge undermine make legible uh changing all these claims and recognizing them as distinct peoples now there's all sorts of ways in which the UN has been a site of contestation people have been showing up uh indigenous communities black communities uh communities that have been oppressed have been showing up in New York in front of um the the general assembly and yelling about these things as long as the U.N has existed we just generally don't recognize or think about those things because they don't come up in standard history so the premise of un drip and it's most simple like to for you to understand is just it's a mechanism to establish the distinct human rights of indigenous communities around the world if you look at the social determinants of health so things that cause negative Health outcomes indigenous communities worldwide have lower social determinants of Health regardless of where they are Sweden wherever then the the settler or dominant population it's it's just this I mean it's there why because of all of these things because of the lack of specific human rights protections this constant desire to assimilate indigenous communities in order to create the modern nation state right to create a a single people and so this distinct peoplehood is challenging the demos of the Democracy right that I've been talking about throughout this course the idea that that happens so there's a duty to consult and cooperate again this isn't explained well in the text specifically in relationship to um the the cons consultation and cooperation remember the honor and dignity the crown is at stake here so it cannot be an adversarial relationship a lot of settlers when they look at things like land claims or they look at the pipeline debates they look at it well we'll just take an adversarial relationship we do this with minority groups all the time they want something and we say no but that's not that adversarial relationship cannot buy our own Constitution it's unconstitutional to do that so um and so you know the Americans love their constitution candidate kind of ignores its Constitution let's say um and so free prior informed consent for resource development and then self uh government self-determination rights more specifically we can get into some of the more specifics of it um indigenous people have the right to maintain and strengthen distinct legal economic and social and cultural Traditions I'll talk about Canada's multi-juridical legal foundations in a bit um I spent a lot more time on it in our international law class that we have at the third year level uh every indigenous every indigenous individual has the right to a nationality right so stripping away nationalities is stripping away their identities in order to create a unified category and so this is the problem of indigenous as a as a way of thinking it's it's a largely an imposed construct that is useful in terms of political mobilization but not necessarily useful in telling us anything about anybody's experience right uh indigenous peoples have and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture so this is I mean I've got web wub canoe talking about this later about the get over it stuff right so that's constant kind of Perpetual Western way of thinking well it's in the past right so why if it's in the past and the whole point here is that it's no it's in the present right it's on constant ongoing and that's what the reservation dogs does really well it deals with the struggles of the the president and the past and with kids right because that's what they have to do right to establish and control their education systems because education is a key form of identity and identity formation and digital people have the right to participate in decision making matters that would affect their rights so rights and then the ability to talk about and defend those rights and Indigenous people have the right to determine their identity and membership in accordance with their own customs and traditions I didn't put anything in here but we have had in the academy and there's been a couple institutions in particular I mean we've been renaming the institutions but we have this phenomenon of pretendians um we have white settlers who just claim to appropriate indigenous identity in order to get access to resources it's kind of like Stolen Valor in the states like pretending like you're a veteran this is a pretending as people doing this this happens there was a a couple of teens who were doing this or claiming they're Inuit in Brampton we have academics judges um people doing this in order to like participate in this and so we have to give the communities the right to do this um to set their own membership and identity especially when people are appropriating that identity for their own purposes and so when we think about these things this this the UN drip is very similar to the the human rights that the charter in the U.N which defines our human rights which we'll talk about when we get to International organizations later in the course your human rights are absolutely enshrined in these documents but they don't have the force of legal status per se because it's up to every individual nation state to set up the legal codes processes appeals processes follow the jurisprudence so the the rules about how you interpret the law in your own culture and tradition right so they're set up differently the key Point here is that the settler States who worked in this process for 30 years when the process was complete rejected the process um and so you know Canada asserted that these were already protected in section 35 of the Constitution Act um they I'll talk a bit about how this resistance happens and why this resistance happens if it took 30 years and it's not legally binding why are why are we still fighting it it just it it's this reflection of the ways in which settlement is an ongoing practice and I'm suspicious the way that the text frames colonialism because we need to talk more about settler colonialism um and so the ways in which appropriation of of attitudes and opinions this is just um there are so many of these I've got a couple I'll just show a couple about the ways in which like these efforts to I guess because we're talking about identity right this chapter is about identity the ways in which this identity becomes distorted so quickly so here we'll we'll talk to this one I think it's great that land acknowledgments are becoming more commonplace you know however I do think there is a time and place for land acknowledgments and one of those times and places is not on Zoom I was working for a company for like most of the lockdown and the head of HR who's very much not indigenous started doing land acknowledgments during our weekly Zoom check-in meetings and there was one meeting where he was like zooming in from his five bedroom home in Upstate New York he's shouting into his camera sorry if it's difficult to hear me I can't figure out how to turn off my indoor waterfall we are on Lenape land I feel like land acknowledgments are going to get co-opted by corporations very much like gay pride I'm dreading the day that I walk into like a Warby Parker and there's like a huge banner and it's just like we're on Stolen land and then right below that it's like you know what else is a steal two frames for forty nine dollars because I will fully walk out over there with four frames I think so um Canada's opposition uh to the U.N drip was based on a bunch of different claims first and foremost you know it's something in the federal government or the idea of sovereignty that makes those who work for the federal government think that a non-binding document would implicate them and and all sorts of legal issues uh so it was framed in terms of Constitution Act and for terms of the charter and the idea of defense and security the idea that this would have implications for how we think about this and so Canada said well we're making lots of progress on the on based on good faith partnership and mutual respect um the assembly First Nation said candidate no do this the metis Federation said they expressed concern and that there was Expressions explicit expressions of why is Canada not doing this Mr Speaker this morning MP's gathered at a meeting on Parliament Hill in support of the U.N Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples the meeting was hosted by a group of organizations including the Assembly of First Nations Amnesty International Canada the Inuit kanatami the Inuit circumpolar Council the Canadian France service committee Kairos and the native women's Association of Canada their voices were strong and unanimous and calling on the government of Canada to fully Implement standards at the declaration adopted by the U.N general assembly on September 13th of last year as members of this house will remember the Declaration was passed by an overwhelming majority vote of 144 to 4 with Canada's conservative government shamefully voting against rights for indigenous people Mr Speaker this government must realize Canadians took pride in our reputation in the role we used to have as human rights champions in the global Community they should take back this role and implement the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples today so this idea of of the problems well one is that we have this act embedded in the Constitution which you know is a testament to White stupidity is that it's called Indian um that this is framed in there and then it defines very clearly relationship status obligations resources all of these things are in there on top of that federalism and this is a Perpetual problem and I'll talk about it a bit when in the context of Caledonia and the Six Nations um that um treaties are set at the federal level but in Canadian federalism provinces have huge amounts of control over landlord water resources and energy and so there's always been this mismatch that the treaty relationships are supposed to be at the federal level but for example in Caledonia you have the opp enforcing land rights for a subdivision that's going on contested territory right um and so without due consultation so this idea is built into that we also have questions about the legality of of practices of forced assimilation which continue to challenge I mean Pam Paul matters argued that I don't have enough of her in here she's on Tick Tock as well um does great work that you know the ways in which it's been reformed a bit but that essentially status is becoming harder and harder to maintain I'll talk about what status is later and that Canada is moving towards a slow-moving genocide where we're going to have many indigenous peoples but none with status right and so this creates all sorts of questions and then the illegal appropriation of territory um this unconstitutional occupation of territory and then at the time Stephen Harper went and has said this so these are all the treaties but Stephen Harper went and said this which wasn't great we have one of the Atlantic regime's unbroken Democratic regimes in the in history we are one of the most stable regimes in history there are very few countries that can say for our nearly 150 years they've had the same political system without any social breakdown political upheaval or invasion uh we are unique in that regard we also have no history of colonialism so we have all of the things that many people admire about the great Powers but none of the things that threaten or bother them about the great Powers we all so that is the the Canada problem um so he he's later said that that was a mistake and he shouldn't have said that um in part because there was so much outrage that he said that um and so by 2010 the government of Canada says that it will support it um this non-binding agreement of it and then Australia New Zealand so these are the four states that voted against it all agreed to its endorsement eventually under great pressure so the problem of course is that how do we frame this understanding of Rights granted this is not even you know barely a decade ago that why is it take so long to do this and so the way that it's framed in the textbook is is in terms of a product of European colonialism I'm going to add the settler in because I think it's appropriate I think it's how we think about these things and I think there's a key distinction here right so this is and we'll talk about what this case this is not the colonialism um the the difference is is as I mentioned earlier in the course salt water versus settler the salt water is normally the use of military forces occupied territory control those people and utilize those people for these ends in many cases what we're doing here is just trying to terminate in in every way treaty obligations rights and lives in order to take the land right so the annexation of territory by Imperial States settlement in and control over those territories um often using the family just simply in Caledonia it's building a subdivision why would you be opposed to building a subdivision because it it violates all of these principles and and treaties and Charter rights that have been established but that we just kind of forget about and subjugation of all these forms of life I'll just do one more tick talk about thinking about the ways in which different communities are involved in these ongoing settlement practices in the ways in which they don't and so Scotland has experienced its own kind of colonial relationship with uh the the British and and then gets framed in terms of how can we think about these things this is also framed in terms of Irish questions and things around that but one of the ways in which this gets built into and forgotten kind of perpetually so here's just a tick tock talking about the ways in which Scotland is implicated in all of these processes learn your own history genocide to the natives slavery stay out of ours this is going to be a hard pill for you to swallow that is your history that is our shared history I mean Edinburgh and Aberdeen and Glasgow the self-titled Second City of the Empire they were built with wealth at colonialism and slavery provided do you think the merchants in merchant City we're selling or how Scotland's first millionaires became millionaires probably not did you think it's just a coincidence that black American and Caribbean people have Scottish surnames do you know why the Jamaican flag has a saltire on it I doubt it I you tell yourself Jamaica street is called that because some glass region just really liked Bob Marley Scotland was a willing and active participant in the colonization of the U.S and the transatlantic slave trade take all the time you need with that so a lot of what we're doing here is just kind of unpacking the ways in which we forget we forget every time we speak we forget what the language we use we forget when we just say oh it's just you know it's just a a mascot team name what's the big deal it's just the name of a street what's the big deal it's just the name of a school what's the big deal and so our language is a foreman this is what I've been kind of arguing throughout the course our language is a form of ongoing practices of forgetting because by choosing who gets to speak how they could speak which language is used and how we frame those issues
 so I just want to do a little bit of the theory of how we talk about um settler colonialism versus colonialism because it's just simply not in the text um settlement is a combination of conquest and migration um migrants moved into someone else's society and then the the settler or the colonial kind of makes it their own so it's this kind of idealization it's not the same as colonialism in part because it doesn't the it there's not an effort there's actually explicitly with the idea of reserves and the refusal to Grant voting to reserves for debt for well until the 70s right um that they don't use them to establish the foundation of their their governance right it's more about non-inclusion so settlement settler colonialism is more about the ability to just dispense or appropriate indigeneity and so unlike the idea of of the kind of mixing the land with your labor indigenous labor was both indispensable but then rejected over and over again and this idea then is is the land is the focus of settler colonialism we don't need to mix the labor of indigenous communities with the land because that's the thing that that we're after and so it comes over and over again um and so this settler part is key because it it explains the dynamic and the ongoing dynamics that this is a practice rather than a past experience so where we have postcolonialism and hybridity when we talk about the relationship of the The Saltwater Colonial experience here we need to talk about the ongoing Colonial practices right um it's this idea they want to derive the authority and then displace The Authority at the same time and so this is common to these settler colonial states in a way that's distinct from Colonial experiences it's this defensive project of the country against both building identity and so there's an absence of culture and identity but also about this appropriating the idea of the the way in which rule is happening happening this idea of establishing an identity where there wasn't one because you're eliminating the other framework so this is uh what what vuta calls the anglo-sphere there's a shared kind of anglospheric identity and so this for example is just one I want to show to talk about the ways in which it's not simply that we're creating identities Anew it's that we appropriate and and malleably change existing indigenous ways of being and then forget about where they came from so I just wanted to do a bit this is long but I want to do a bit about the offensiveness of how um that Mount Rushmore came about and that it's the six grandfathers and it was chosen specifically as a settler strategy which then becomes kind of lost to the way that we think a general like tedx but I mean this is a good quote right like one man's Shrine is another man's Cemetery like we really need to think about this and you know we've done a lot of Reckoning um especially um after black lives matter about kind of statues and the ways in which memorialization happens but this is this to me is just so messed up between 1927 and 1941 400 workers blasted 450 000 tons of rock from a Mountainside using chisels jackhammers and a lot of dynamite gradually they carved out Mount Rushmore now the monument draws nearly 3 million people to South Dakota's Black Hills every year its facade that lies a dark history about ten thousand years ago Native American people began inhabiting the Black Hills the area became especially sacred to the Lakota people who formed the Western Branch of what the U.S called the Sioux Nation the Lakota believed one came within the Black Hills to be where they first emerged and they named one of the Black Hills mountain peaks the six grandfathers after their sacred directional spirits but in the 1800s Lakota access to this land came under threat white settlers in North America expanded their territories by using physical violence or negotiating with indigenous peoples after its establishment in the late 1700s the U.S government ratified hundreds of treaties with Native American nations however it often broke them or created them using coercion between 1866 and 1868 the Lakota and their allies successfully defended their land from the U.S military and negotiated a new treaty with the government in the 1868 treaty at Fort Laramie all parties agreed that a vast territory including the Black Hills belong to the Sioux Nation in return the Lakota would allow U.S travelers to pass safe through but many aspects of the treaty also aimed to assimilate the Lakota into white culture this included incentives to convert them from hunting to farming abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and where clothes the U.S provided meanwhile just seven years later the U.S broke the treaty after an expedition found gold in the Black Hills miners set up camps the military attacked and ultimately defeated the Lakota and the U.S passed legislation illegally seizing the land 50 years later like it it's wild to me we'll talk about this but what is the law what the hell is a constitution you know and it's so many people like scream about certain parts of the First Amendment the Second Amendment all the rest of the Constitution but the ability to break your own laws and defend the law and use the law as a I guess it's a it's a political tool in these these mechanisms as a way of legitimating the existence of certain bodies and delegitimating the existence of others because it's you can't say you're following the law when you just you agree to a treaty you break the treaty you agree to another treaty you break the treaty right like it's so workers began etching into the lakota's sacred six grandfather's Mountain the project was led by an arrogant sculptor named Goodson Borglum who had ties to the KKK the historian originally proposed that Mount Rushmore include Western figures like Lakota Chief Red Cloud but Borglum chose to feature his own Heroes by October of 1941 Borglum had died from surgical complications and works stopped though the project was unfinished none of the four figures had torsos as intended and Rubble was left piled below to the Lakota the Monument was a desecration and the presidents immortalized on the rock face all had brutal anti-indigenous legacies members of the Iroquois Confederacy called George Washington Town Destroyer for encouragement I mean I have a whole Tick Tock about it but I didn't want to show it because it's just it and it's so heavy and and brutal um that like listen you absolutely look I can give you the links to it look it up but um it's hard like you'll shut it's hard to shut down learning when people feel emotionally weighted they should feel emotionally weighted but again that you won't learn if I do too much of it using military campaigns that burned 50 of their villages in 1779. Theodore Roosevelt championed forced assimilation and said I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead indians but I believe 9 out of ten are in 1980 after the Sioux Nation had sued the U.S for treaty violations the Supreme Court ruled that the Black Hills had been unlawfully taken and the suit were entitled to compensation the amount named has since reached over a billion dollars but the Sioux Nation refused to take the money and give up their claim to the Black Hills maintaining that they were never for sale so what should happen to Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills responses to that question are wide-ranging some including tribal leaders and borglum's great-granddaughter have called for Mount Rushmore to be removed others see it as an important patriotic symbol in vital aspect of South Dakota's economy that should remain many Lakota people want the 1868 treaty to be honored and the now federally controlled lands to be returned to their tribal communities others have said that the Lakota in the U.S should at least co-manage parts of the Black Hills currently there are no plans for change the U.S broke many of its promises with indigenous Nations making issues like this common native people have been fighting for broken treaties to be honored for Generations achieving some major victories along the way meanwhile if untouched the face is engraved on the sixth grandfather's Mountain are expected to remain for thousands of years to come so yeah it's the extent to scale the scope the um and we can do that there's so many things we can do this with I mean we had a football team that was named a racial slur and the biggest sport in America up till like 2020 and the only reason that it got changed was because they thought changing that would be a symbolic effort to deal with why black lives matter protesting started it just it's it's all symbolic hand waving it's very very weird anyways so that's set up a colonialism
 so as I mentioned at the end of the last video the law in Canada is a key part of how we can think about settler colonialism rights and responsibilities um it's our possibility of thinking it and in a real sense the law bounds identity and so we're talking about indigenous identities I don't know how you can talk about it without talking about status so this is I think it was a Maori um tick tocker asking a tick talker about what is status and how does that function in Canada because it's it's different right each state and each territory has different ways of doing it um but I don't know what a status card is so I'm actually just making this video to open up the floor to this is a status card as you can see up there it says certificate of Indian status because in Canada the legal definition is still Indian as Indian and this is only for people who are First Nations this does not include the other two indigenous groups in Canada the Inuit or the metis eligibility for a status is set by the government it's not set by our own peoples [Music] um and it's been over the years over the decades centuries it has had a lot of sexism within it so before 1985 the status Indian woman married a non-status man she lost her status their kids a longer at status but if a status man married a non-sized woman that woman for 1985 gained full Indian status and got all the rights and entitlements of that allowed and there's also different categories within the status of the six one and the six two so six one is what would be considered against like a full Indian six two is half so if a 6-1 has a kid with a non-status person if their kid is a six two the six two as a kid to the non-statist person their kid will not have status eligility may have just changed recently there's been several changes so you know that might not be the case I just became eligible for Indian status two years ago my mom has had status since I was born my grandmother was born and raised on a reserve so I very much know my community know my family there since birth you know the status card doesn't change who I am it just now entitles me to certain rights that I didn't have before this includes now I can vote for Chief and Council for my band elections which we have one coming up June 1st I'm gonna be 35 next month and this is the first time I've been eligible to vote um it also entitles me to certain health benefits so Optical Medical Dental that unless I had health benefits through work I didn't really have the coverage for that kind of stuff I'm also now eligible for tax exemption sales tax exemption uh when I'm shopping so certain goods and services within uh this is the province of Ontario if I show my status card I'll have part of the taxes removed and then if I lived on or on reserve and worked on reserve I would be entitled to the exempt from paying income taxes which is not the case for all status Indians depending where they live and who they work for and now that I have status I am a member of my first nation now if I went to post-secondary school I could apply for funding to help pay for my tuition housing this and that that so that I wouldn't potentially have to pay or get a student loan which I currently had to do because at what I went to University in college before I got status so I have status that like many people do so I hope that helps and anyone feel free to jump in if they have any corrections or anything anything to add into it in the comments um so I mean there's this this weird way in which settlements status treaties obligations qualification identity are still bound up in the settler State and the the legal claims and the adjudication of those claims and the disputes over those claims and the the constant kind of churning so much so that like we we both have to double check our sources all the time on what's the current status of status right which I mean not being able to vote till you're 35 having student loans because your status wasn't adjudicated it's just it it's weird right um it's not weird it's gross but you know whatever um and so Canada has all sorts of of legal traditions because it has uh civil law common law indigenous legal Traditions they all exist here they're overlapping the French have a different jurisprudence a different way of adjudicating law than British common law remember the Brits don't have a constitution they just have a series of precedents that we refer back to Major precedents that then inform how we interpret cases right and so there's a general lack of knowledge about Canada's indigenous law as I started from the beginning of this course the Great Law of Peace is an international treaty that predates West failure that the 19648 treaty the Canadian Supreme Court recognizes the continued existence of indigenous legal traditions and very clearly said settlement did not terminate the interest in Aboriginal people's arriving from their historic occupation and use of the land but we still have this is John Burroughs I took all this from John Burroughs his work on Canada's indigenous history um where he says he's encountered I've encountered I have talked to lawyers uh real estate lawyers corporate lawyers all the rest of that I've talked to them personally um and they say exactly this you say indigenous law exists I don't believe it for a moment okay good talk um and so we have these legacies that are built into how we we deal with this to the monarchy still part of the identity the crown is still the one that we engage in that uses the basis of authority like if it's a crown why can't we just remove it and put something else there um and so I do think it's this idea of having multiple Traditions should make us more cautious about definitively saying this is what Canada is because for uh the quebecois for um different communities within Canada they have different experiences of when their Province entered into Confederation or didn't um and and the recognition of this and so there's this kind of fiction that we re reproduce I guess with with hockey and beer of a single Canadian identity versus this Multicultural tradition that's not about cultures necessarily of settlers of different cultural backgrounds but of of the different kind of legal precedents that establish what like what you can do when you can vote things like that um we have all this it's already built into our thing we have Canada Queen God as these kind of sacred legal Traditions that are basis of authority that are have to do with a specific understanding of Faith rather than you know this idea that treaties create values and the hot energy entered into a series of alliances in Joseph Brandt in particular a series of alliances with the crown prior to the existence of Canada right I think well not Joseph Brandt but but these these relationships uh are established well before Canada is confederated right um and so weirdly enough using natural law whether we saw with Hub and lox and Rousseau um indigenous peoples are natural because it doesn't make any logical sense because if they have structures or they have capabilities or medicines their Traditions or practices or theories or States then the the Locking and mixing your land with labor comes apart right and so this idea of of framing capacities which we use all the time we recognize all the time part of the the reason that none of it exists as none of it is that it was a mutual recognition between the federal government and and none of it as a territory that we could use in our Arctic sovereignty claims when we fight with the Russians and the Americans um different in Inuit communities their existence on the territory for ten thousand years to argue that that's Canadian sovereignty and so it's this weird kind of of function and so here's just wob canoe talking about this this 500 years went wrong wasn't always like this when we started down the path when the settlers first arrived the natives welcome them and help them out it wasn't like they showed up and the native said oh there goes the neighborhood and the relationship grew stronger fashionable even remember these it's a beaver hat this was considered cool back in the day that's right our rodents were all the rage in 17th century Europe that led to the fur trade and of course the fur trade gave us Canada like most major Canadian cities were fur trading outposts and all of this was because we were settling at the fur Traders were trading beaver pelts to go on top hats in Europe fashion is an integral part of what it why Canada is where it is and what it matters it's closest to the beaver right so like beavers dictate Canada and this has been a long-running joke about Canada and the Beaver um ceases in the 80s had a logo that was a beaver with sunglasses the Canadian Security intelligence service had added sunglasses logo with it like pulled up secret a secret Beaver as their logo for a time they we documented that in wampum belts like this one that depict two canoes traveling down the river in parallel paths neither one interfering with the other stay in your life and the English and French well for their part they signed all sorts of big agreements with great seals ever since the Royal Proclamation of 1763 there's been Banner promises like the natives will not be molested or my personal favorite the Queen's promise to the cree of bounty and benevolence you know we Aboriginal people thought we were getting a seat at the big table but it turns out we had a reservation at a much smaller table out the back near the garbage cans at the big table they got Canada and all of its Bounty at our table a total lack of benevolence we got the plague a plague of whiskey and our parents and Grandparents were molested in schools designed to Kill The Indian in the child so where did all of that go wrong well step into my office grab a seat on the big couch and let's talk so that's from CBC 8th Fire series that was kind of went through all this stuff but again if we don't watch it it becomes historical it's like oh that's old look at how uh uh look at how it is all grainy and all the rest of it so anyways um we'll come to this at the Terra nollis is a Perpetual theme of this chapter um about the idea of land and then it not being occupied um in the legal literature um you know it was too unfamiliar to the settlers for us to understand indigenous law um we use English law in our textbooks when we think about law there is a central Paradox here of that the crown sought indigenous agreement before settlement and Indigenous communities had to be recognized by the crown but weren't equal to the crown and so the discovery of land by treaty meant that there had to be some existence of somebody there um and so how can you enter into a treaty with someone who doesn't have rights right or doesn't exist and so it's this this weird uh framework I I'm actually not going to deal with this the the danger of the the Canadian people here is that it's part of this fictitious beginning of those who are outside the law are somehow not part of the people which doesn't make a ton of sense um the people is often used as the foundation like the threat to the people is used for us to for example in the war measures act suspend everyone's rule of law and it also allows the people to to do things like um take those who are seemingly in Canada but aren't the people to be interned and so the history of Canada is also about the history of putting people in in specific places because we consider them not people German Slavic ukrainians during World War one German Italian Japanese during World War II um the weird part about all of this land claim negotiation and this is from finding Dasha Stephanie ilbecker Fox has a book on this specifically dealing with the DNA and they're dealing with um land claims and that this is the experience of uh what land claims actually looks like and why it takes so long to do these territory things so if you get a new job in the federal government um they're normally appointed by officials from Ottawa with limited knowledge of these issues they're universally educated um uh non-indigenous who normally have one indigenous advisor they get given a series of bottom lines but from the federal government they have to submit spending reports and the funding levels so that's Indian Northern Affairs Canada um they they submit them to the federal government which kind of uses that as part of the costs and those funding levels are determined by the bureaucracy the extent to which they're actually going to substantially engage in negotiation they're largely done in English with local translators three to five days a month with local community centers so if you want to know why some of these land claims take decades and decades to adjudicate it's because you're dealing with a federal government that by all metrics given in the territory of Canada is relatively weak versus the resources of the provinces and they are flown in to deal with this they tend to be male and they tend to do this in order to get a stepping stone to a better job in the federal government so they have a high level of burnout they have short-term positions they're frustrated with this remote this remote status so people who are ignorant of the context and history come in and why do they how do you negotiate with people who hate you they're not here to change the past right this type of kind of the blankness of the western experience and then on the other side you have the indigenous negotiators from the community have an extensive knowledge of the history the process the land claims may or may not have University knowledge of the federal government's experience the region probably going back a very long time of the previous claims the legal assumptions so every time you enter into this every three to five years you have to bring the whoever's been sent in back up to speed talk to them about what there are they're trying to deal with their bottom lines and that they're doing it so we've got lots of examples of this but like David Peterson there's a whole bunch of of politicians who when they retired um even um uh oh my God it's not Gretchen it's um Paul um Paul Martin when he retired he decided to go just deal with these issues because from the inside we have multiple leaders at high levels that I got onto this issue from it was a federal judge who after he um retired did nothing but spent his time working on the 1763 Proclamation um and so it's because they get into this and they say we have to educate the government officials while negotiating their erroneous assumptions their ignorance their lack of knowledge and it just results in negotiation after negotiation after decade after decade so like that video we saw in the past when you're dealing with with something as as absurd as a treaty that should have been dealt with in the 1800s this is why it continues to the present they they continued the present then it goes through appeals over and over again the law is integral to settlement it legitimates settlement but it also drags these things out and the deployment of these strategies of settlement are ongoing this is why we're talking about treaties so much this is why we're doing reconciliation it's to overcome this structural problem that is built into the way that we think about the relationship of the law to what it means to be on this territory
 so the past and present are all kind of one here when we're talking about this the colonial past and Colonial presence that subtle colonialism is is bound up in this um you know in 1490 indigenous peoples were 20 of global population that Century later three percent um Global Colonial capitalism that's not a great concept but extractivism is a better one we'll deal with that and so the acquisition and commodification of these lands resource extraction settlement and imposition of rule but it's also the forgetting it's the it's the con it's the massive Reformation of these societies at the same time they're experiencing massive population loss forced resettlement all the rest of it so here's just a weird way to think about um some of the kind of precepts of forgetting when we're dealing with what settlement does not one ingredient in apple pie is indigenous to North America not the apples not the flower not the butter or lard not the cinnamon not the sugar nothing nutmeg I'm trying to um be honest about the origins of our food and through that by proxy being honest about the origins of this country so she's just talking about here at the Apple Pie as American as apple pie is every single aspect of of just you can just look up look up all of them look up the ways in which um land ingredients reshaping animal husbandry settlement uh farming are all bound up in this kind of remaking of of land right of taking the land and and reformat planting trees on it up and down the coast that then become the source of food a new food source that then becomes a a marker of American identity and so all of this weirdly enough indigenous lands are treated as as non-existent um the messed up part about reserves is that normally they were chosen because they were not farmable or not seen as as Prime Land part of the reason that they weren't farmable was because they probably had some other resource on it that was impeding the growth of that resource so as we found with apple water Scott Apple water Scout was this this um terrible uh um situation no drinking water lack of resources all sorts of uh crises Health crises that was taking place next to a de Beer's mine because um Apple water Scott also had a huge mining situation situation right next to it all of these reservations why we're having these land claim reservations is because it was assumed that the land wasn't worth anything so it was was literally deeded through constitutional right and treaty to these communities who now for example when we want to build our oil pipelines we have to put them through these very spaces and we're running into this problem there's no consent why would there be consent they're not necessarily getting the the benefits of these and so um you know reforming this is kind of basic stuff we don't need to deal too much with it but it's this continually unfolding process it's rooted in the dominant framework as I talked about before you know it's just in 2023 the Vatican finally rejects the doctrine of discovery um and then we have related issues that were still ongoing I mean still ongoing when it became clear that that residential schools um had grave sites all around them at first it was shocking and then it very obviously became clear that this was policy um in that the scale and scope was so outrageous and large because remember they were trying to kill the Indian and the child got lots of children's books on this too if you'd like to see them and so this is still a kind of way that we think about all of these different territories were were claimed under the idea that there was no prior state or prior sovereignty in the area so 1648 does matter in that it is a mutual recognition of equal sovereigns and so if you weren't in equal Sovereign by any mechanism those sovereigns could just literally take your territory so this is at this the access to territory is the difference between colonialism Etc colonialism primarily because colonialism is concerned with kind of domination of the existing population in order to produce um resources that get sent back whereas settler colonialism just like they want to land right um Federal power over uh Indians and lands reserved to Indians the settlement to the West the Americans have largely dealt with this they have extinguished the treaties they just unilaterally terminated them it's much harder to do because of the way that the constitution is structured and the 1763 Royal Proclamation we embedded in our constitution the treaties are an integral part of uh Canadian law and so we can't do those as easily and the dispossession of lands the the having like let's be clear if you're on a reserve you had to apply for a permit to leave the reserve to sell your goods off Reserve to the federal government in Ottawa right these reserves are all over the place in very remote regions and so it's just it's just Bonkers um Indian Act regulates every aspect of life like we talked about with the status thing that that's still ongoing it's still gone going mandated education through residential schools banned system of governments didn't establish and still we don't have established this day kind of democratic mechanisms on reserves for how they should be adjudicated I'm saying this from former students of mine who are indigenous who said like I still don't get to participate in a democracy because we don't have those but it's not at all clear that yeah whose values and what type of political order should be done and how it should be done there and just restricting indigenous participation in the settler economy is understating the extent to which um these The Taking of territory and then refusing to even allow you to sell the goods you make on The Reserve right stuff like that so it's it's all bound up in this so land is everything um uh land is everything because it's the foundation of all the the benefit right the the money the resources and so land back has become a persistent question here um so here's just one there's something that feels Canadian wow and what is the land back land back and so this is uh one of the the hashtags that's out at the moment this continues along tradition of establishing that there is this land was never um uh given away in many places it was illegally taken and that we have this push towards uh dealing with we'll deal with this in extractivism in the next video
 okay um we are now shifting to discussing um identities and so in discussing identities I'm not really sure what this chapter is about it says those things um I'm not convinced that's actually what it's about for a whole bunch of different reasons um I I I'm interested in this topic um I I like discussing this topic I like writing about this topic um so I I have a lot here I'm engaged I'm trying to do my best to to synthesize it it's impossible right it's a big big broad issue um and so I'm I want to have it be more engaging because I think it is an engaging issue so um in terms of of thinking about this chapter then we're drawing on these traditions and I think it's doing the same thing as the last chapter which is why actually I don't think it's about indigenous people at all so what we're talking about here is the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous people U.N drip um we'll discuss the centrality of land and land use and settler colonialism okay uh defining to discuss extractivism sure uh Trace different strategies of indigenous land dispossession um okay and then explain the difference between consultation and consent and sure and identify the tensions in indigenous government relationships this is kind of the reality of what's going on here um we aren't really going to be exploring indigeneity in any substantive way I think that's what indigenous studies does I'm not sure that political science is the the best space to do that our starting assumptions might not be appropriate that doesn't mean we're not going to engage it substantively with these issues it just means that I'm not going to claim Authority that this is doing indigenous studies and I think that's the danger of this chapter just like when we're doing non-western stuff last week this week we're not really doing indigeneity we're doing settler attitudes towards structures that have framed indigenetic right um so what we're really talking about then when we're talking about the centrality of land and land the Houston settler colonialism that's primaries still an extractivist Colonial attitude right um we'll Define and discuss extractivism but again primarily that's about the Western Construction so it's it's like when we're talking about non-western ideas now here we're talking about like a settler relationships with efforts to settle it's very strange uh we'll trace the different strategies of indigenous land dispossession and again that sounds like it's a politics for the leader for the one in charge I'm going to do a bit more of the ways in which we can talk about indigenous mobilization against these processes um explain the difference between consultation and consent sure I I'm not really really what that has to do it's a it's a narrow legal framing of a much broader substantive question about about um what candidate is right and then identified tensions in indigenous government relationship relationships doing a lot of heavy lifting in that um relationship uh implies it implies a whole bunch of things I I don't know why we wouldn't use hierarchy or oppression or resistance or um resilience whatever word you want we just don't use that here so there's a problem that's all who's built in well I've got lots of for me the main thing is that I have tons of serious content the danger with this framing of serious content is that it's not it reproduces the kind of the the patterns of politics of where politics happens and who gets to speak and how they get to speak and it doesn't adequately reflect what's going on this is very similar to I'll unpack I've got lots of funny videos on land acknowledgment and the idea that what ends up happening this with with women this is called the double bind and then increasingly the triple bind when they're when um women's experience is originalized or forms of marginalization in this case what we're doing is like expecting indigenous communities to do the work of unpacking settlement or we utilize them as in ways to do that which is kind of absurd and so I've got easy ways to to deal with this I mean this is taika watiti those are all the things he's done including Thor love and thunder and I can't speak about reservation dogs enough because it is the type of stuff that we need to be thinking about which is the existence of patterns of the past and the present co-contaminantly so we've been talking about these these Legacy of Greek ideas um for that show it's dealing with the legacies of long-standing ideas in the present uh but does it fun in a funny way um humor is often the capability of those who exist in a majority Community but as minority groups so um there's a long tradition of of comedy and comedians because they can participate and see from the outside the absurdity of the participation so humor tells us a lot about the experiences of of marginalized communities um and so that's and this is why punching up and punching down are not the same and it's wide fascist humor doesn't really exist okay um it's just uh forms of racism uh anyways let's let's go with taikova TD here stop asking us what to do how things all right so tired of this I'm so tired I'm so tired of this the diversity conversation inclusivity conversation all the conversations all of us want to be working and not having to come and do [ __ ] panels and speeches on the middle of our day this is a great thing it's good that we're talking about it we have to keep talking about it but this is the [ __ ] you got us doing you wonder why there's no indigenous stuff out there this is the [ __ ] all right making us come and talk about the problem and tell you how to fix it you [ __ ] broke it you fix it if I can ask us what to do someone coming into your house killing all your [ __ ] and burning your house down and then saying okay we need to have a talk about this and then saying now you're going to rebuild your house me and what can we give you to help you rebuild your house that we burnt down you build the [ __ ] house you burned it down and if you don't get together then we'll try again so it's this I this very clear idea that what we're talking about is often not about um the experiences of indigenous people so we're talking about identity but we're not actually talking about indigenous people per se we're talking about settler attitudes towards indigenous people and that indigenous experiences are quite different um and this is I mean reservation dogs this this stems from the there's a comedy group that that taekwatiti coordinated and that they developed this show it's on Disney Plus foreign [Music] looks as though you've tasted the white man's lead it's only paintballs I've had many brothers and sisters meet the same Fate In My Time are you crazy horse or sitting no no no I'm not one of those awesome guys no I'm more of your uh I'm more of your unknown Warrior yeah you know my name William nice man I was at the Battle of Little Bighorn that's right I didn't kill anybody but I fought bravely well I didn't actually fight I actually didn't even get into the fight itself but I came over that Hill real rugged like I saw a custard like that that yellow hair he was sitting there Son Of The Morning Star that guy right there [ __ ] I really hated him so I went after him but then the damn horse hit a gopher hole [ __ ] rolled over and squashed me I died there this horse actually a little [ __ ] and now I'm meant to travel the spirit world find lost souls like you the spirit world it's cold my nipples are always hard I'm always hungry got it being a warrior it's not always easy you and you Dougie asked friends what are you doing for your people it's easy to be bad it's hard to be a warrior with dignity remember that in my time we gave everything we died for our people we died for our land what are you gonna do what are you going to fight for I just [ __ ] with you but for real though listen to what I said marinate on it I hope let's go uh good times so it's not about thinking about the past it's about framing things through the present and so and this is just I mean this is very abstract this is largely my formulation you don't need to worry too much about this but this helps us explain the binaries we keep talking about in the western tradition is that Greek thought organizes through opposition self either good evil male female mind body and so it incorporizes it incorporates difference through knowledge and this is what we talked about last time with the university being a source of authority over knowledge is a way of appropriating the experiences of others and then presenting them to benefit the academy the west and those who are experts and so this has always been a problem in studying indigenous communities is that the West the and the Anthropologist the researcher takes those experiences that they find there the insights they find there and then make them for themselves and so this has been happening over time and this is these colonizing practices of knowledge production so I'll talk about this in the context of or colonialism in a bit I would say there's all different ways of doing it one of the reasons that I'm focused on anti-Semitism throughout the course is that this this organization through indifference or between Believers non-believers ethics and reasons um we don't have to get into too much this stems from from habermust but uh or not habermas um uh it doesn't matter the idea of organization through practice is lebanos sorry organization through practices and this specifically that you can convert into Judaism and that we there's this relationship between Judaism and through the right of return the ability to get citizenship but the idea here is that the indifference of the Hebrew Faith to the idea of what others is doing is fundamentally different than the the conversion of a Christianity right and so indigenous practices is then organized through relation uh oral tradition this idea that you're repeating the stories of the past but making them your own this kind of imminent Foundation of this the historical basis of the present and so that is a funny Disney Plus show in Canada dealing with a bunch of kids who live on a reserve but are dealing with contemporary modern issues at the same time they're dealing with his the historical is always present whereas we like to especially with revolutionary and and um uh breaking thought you know the West always wants to wipe everything out and start anew wipe it out start a new wipe it out and start anew so it lacks that historical president so the idea here is that it's a dialogical relationship that indigenous traditions in this isn't in general but more often than not can coexist with multiple cultures and traditions which we don't have and so there's ways in which like this gets replicated in how we think about things all the words that we use that stem directly from these issues now those words stemming from the issues is the way that the West immediately colonizes ideas appropriates those ideas and forgets about them I don't haven't developed it enough yet I've got a couple articles on it but like whiteness is a form of forgetting that that's really what whiteness is it's a forgetting of tradition of passive of history in order to set Anew and set in a kind of naive ignorant way about these the places in which we are and so this idea is that that the languages we use and the way in which we use them help us structure our relationship to what we know and how we can know it these ideas in which we have languages that are Concepts that are inherently racist these codes I mean famously the code break workers in World War II I think it was the Lakota were using indigenous languages as code that couldn't be understood so even if they broke the code in World War II they didn't understand the the language and they didn't have the context history metaphors and and understanding so they even if they got the language they didn't understand the language themselves and so we have this Persistence of of language as a form of representation this is the National Congress of American Indians did the did this campaign specifically about the use of racist mascots that they've now been renamed to the Guardians to show how offensive it is that these communities and they still exist all over the place indigenous ways of being are represented but they're represented in a way that is really about settlers and not about indigeneity and so this is still persistent in sports teams like we're just dealing with we just got rid of the Washington racial slurs as a mascot that was during covid right like this stuff is so present it's ever present but at the same time the West always frames it as past and it's not past because people have to live this experience and so that's what we're going to get into today to avoid the framing of this as historical and therefore something to worry about a long time ago and see that the ways in which it's it's kind of constantly present and so I'm not sure this is about indigeneity per se I think it's more about settler attitudes towards indigenity
 so this is an addendum I'm not even sure I'm gonna put it I might put it in the playlist but I might hide it from the video I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet um this comes out of in the international relations Capstone last term um we were looking at a bunch of students you know the billionaires were all doing the Space Race so we were talking about space and the likelihood of space colonization and my you know ears pricked up when I heard the word colonization I'm like I wonder to what extent this is actually settler colonialism is our future as well so it's not just the past it is the future and when I looked I was shocked and horrified about how it was actually more of the future than I could have even conceived of now I don't want to punch down a teenager um but he summarizes the issues well that specifically come from this and we have the UN Industrial Development organization talking about how space exploration will save the environment it's largely been framed in terms of extractivism this has you know a couple thousand views and this is a bit old but this summarizes quite aptly how we frame these issues and how misguided we are going to replicate the same patterns over and over again I don't think we've learned anything I don't have any evidence that we are actually doing any more thought on this than we have from 1648. 1492. so this is I mean there is a there you know a benefit in the ignorance of the young right and that it is they can clearly explain issues as they've learned it from us and that they have the best of intentions and I am in no way criticizing his intentions or his his um I think this is very audible admirable leadership that's that's what I'll say about that how do we catalyze a change in the way our society buys sells produces manufactures well this question is fundamental to making our civilization more sustainable and our civilization more sustainable answering it we usually turn to economists and this man no no we don't we don't turn to economists because they call everything negative externalities the ideal of functioning of an efficient market with Sublime demand which um amalgamates all the available information to make the most efficient decisions and outcomes does not have a theory of the negative externalities of the ecological costs of growth it makes sense but I'm a science-focused high school student and a highly qualified non-economist and I find the technological aspect to be extremely interesting because so this is ecological techno fetishism which is just the idea that if we put more and more resources behind technology they will result in more efficient outcomes the graph I showed earlier of um the the use of energy consumption is what's called jevin's paradox jevin's paradox is that as Things become more energy efficient we feel that it's not as costly to use them hence we use more of it so there is no indication that we are decreasing in any way our energy consumption through the use of new technologies what we are seeing is that we're using more of it more efficiently so I guess that's good I can actually correlate I have done this before I can you can correlate the history of Western economic growth in terms of GDP to the Discovery and deficiency of new forms of energy it's weird because as it turns out Humanity's first fully sustainable Society won't actually be here on Earth it'll be on Mars I developed an interest in space a place that doesn't have a clear source of energy or of water I'm not sure how that would be sustainable it's at a young age and I think one of the most important parts of space exploration boils down to one really convenient thought self-sustainability you see conducting a mission Beyond who is self is this no man is an island is this an individual is this a situated social context is this an absence of context in history is Mars functioning as the imaginary Blank Slate upon which we can imagine a new world that will be efficient because we can engineer it to to be so I will show you how that's not the case in like two minutes I don't even know he doesn't Okay um this is the cosmology modernity it came out in 78. nature is a virtually Limitless Storehouse of resources for human use Humanity has the commission to use and control nature nature is malleable and can be reconfigured for human ends Humanity has the right perhaps even the calling to use Nature's resource for an improvement of its material standard of living sure listen you know this is the idea that life is a fight against entropy like energy is always moving energy is always being lost we're trying to preserve more of it to extend our lives sure quality of life is further by economic system to direct it to ever expanding material abundance okay but physics says that we're on a ball and that ball all has a limited energy amount of energy or we've got to tap all the energy coming from the big fiery ball that's giving us all of our energy the future is open systemic material for the whole human race again we've got race and we've got human bound up in there and through the careful use of human powers and Humanity can make history turn out right sure um there's so many loaded questions the things we create are under our control the good life is one of productive labor and material well-being the successful person is one who achieves it on their own successful progress and interests are served by achievement oriented behavior work ethic is essential to human being there's freedom and material abundance when people have more their freedom of choices expanded and will ever be more uh uh so we could frame this a bit differently the Earth is sacred and we are sacrilegious we are uh part of a world that we are actively destroying and now seeking to extract resources from another world because we've limited this one climate change is then framed as a lived experience and not a preventable one we don't because of that all of those assumptions lead to all of these things Humanity seems to be this is the concept of the anthropocene we'll talk about later in the course the most single destructive force in nature we have changed the course of nature in part because we don't think we are part of nature because of all the assumptions and that climate volatility is and uncertainty is the norm and so part of the way that we overcome that is to create a new blank slate and a new place where we can extract new resources and a new sustainable future so what I did with this exercise with the class is that we just picked two things one of these I picked from 2021 so not long ago thinking about these questions the underlying assumptions a lot of this stuff goes back to which has been criticized a bit but doesn't have a lot to say NASA was a little more critical of this idea that Innovation is the foundation of space exploration um so what have Americans done they have largely privatized their space exploration because they want to unleash the power of free interest Enterprise to lease a United Humanity permanently into the solar system sure um this is largely reproducing the frontier rhetoric of settlement of North America the frontier is a archetype that is used in masculinity in particular it was used by dieffenbaker it was also used by JFK as the idea that we are moving forward that progress comes from us pushing into train where we previously were not before the frontier needs to be explored dominated extracted and and taken for our benefit at the expense of it it is just nature and it is the dominant metaphor in space exploration it is still in the the stuff that comes all over the place Stephen Hawking Elon all of them talk about this about how space exploration will happen okay space Advocates have based their stuff on a very specific understanding of the past that has no recognition of the ways in which energy sources have gone in to facilitate and their ever increasing use of the excuse me processes of settlement and expansion it reinforces and reinterprets myths beliefs and archetypes into the originating civilization narrative right the idea of knowing of creating commercial empires of outmaneuvering political economic and religious competitors it makes War diplomacy proselytizing scholarship and trade by other means so we get a lot of these metaphors about Wilderness the American frontier American Manifest Destiny that they have an obligation and that let's be clear the majority white OB has an obligation to to these places it is Theirs to dominate dominate This Mother Earth patriarchy oppression sexism all those stuff built into that Wilderness is a place that is there to be dominated and tamed by science and reason versus nature and those bodies that are there do not count as bodies and so we've got this framework of Astro environmentalism that somehow going over there will prevent the problems that we've done here so we can do this in terms of the first space colony and we see how immediately this whole thing falls apart okay great if you get a crew of ten you can send them to Mars and you will basically have to deal with governance structures relating to their individual psychology and their legitimacy and it's likely prone to collapse it can't reproduce itself 10 is not enough to create a viable civilization okay so now we need a community so let's do a hundred let's ship a hundred to Mars the members can compete better over positions they can compare expertise they can have a shared sense of legitimacy their governments will be Mission commanders unrest can be lowered by elections it's a hundred it's easy to do elections bring broader legitimacy to the government system and um but they still don't stop the uh the idea of having single elected persons dominating everyone else elections will not solve the problems of deliberation needed by various experts okay so let's send a society of a thousand so a thousand can better reproduce um they will develop their values and normative behaviors um they will have branches of government that are are allowed them to be questioned they will develop local Dynamics their independence will give them senses and sources of power their experts will have uh higher degrees of respect their politicization of expertise is going to be inevitable there will be distinctions between practicality and scientists expertise versus democracy and deliberation will happen so okay even if we do those things we have all these questions of governance of Science and Engineers that we send to do this Libertarians believe that governments aren't willing to do these things and therefore it shouldn't be based on governments it should be based on technical expertise exceptionists believe that we have to do this in order to benefit us and commuterians say that they are going to build a better future because they're going to start with commuterine starting points this is settler colonialism all over again the easiest way we can do this is you are creating new Society what's the racial composition who gets to be where how many people get to be there how do his race still exist does race not exist if race doesn't exist you've got forms of culture and hierarchy that are already there how are you going to deal with those who's going to pick those what is it going to look like is this just a new form of white supremacy elsewhere is it going to democratically represent the place we have here there and the weird part is is that things like scientists aren't necessarily useful so we don't actually want a thinking crew when we go abroad we want those who are able to build things and do things the Social Development of ideas is largely done on Earth and on Mars they need people to implement those forms of Frameworks we are still going to have to have a deep connection between the scientists who at scale have to develop things using massive amounts of resources to come up with those innovations that are implemented on Mars so there's going to be a deep connection between the place where we start from and the place where we end up the civilization we create now on top of that the problem that happens immediately is that the instant people sit in a new Terror territory and we know this from the Boston Tea Party the American Revolution the French Revolution the Haitian revolution once people get a degree of autonomy from the place in which they have come they're going to start to identify themselves differently they will be martians we are back to politics so we have to deal with the idea of how stable is the system going to be who is going to have authority these questions of expertise of science are going to come from Earth versus here we're going to want to develop Martian science as distinct from the Reliance on earth science and that Martian science is going to want to expand and get more and more resources so we're going to have these questions about who is in charge what's the foundation of their Authority is their Foundation of authority that they come from Earth what is that going to mean for the generation after them who see themselves as truly Martian how does that Martian identity deal with the Earth identity how are they related to each other who has sense of authority what's the foundation of authority what's the social contract that binds them and do Martians have more legitimate authority over Mars than the earth people do over Mars how do these come together how are these bound together we have all of these questions what kind of security are we going to have what do we do when someone breaks the law what's the basis of Law and Authority are we going to establish the based on the law of authority from Earth or from their new system are we going to draw Traditions whose Traditions are going to draw from are we going to draw from indigenous Traditions are we going to draw from uh White Traditions that we draw from African Traditions how are we going to do this how are we going to establish political security what kind of sustainability are we talking about here whose resources are going together how are we going to allocate those resources are we going to allocate them racially are we going to put them in a form of Communism are we going to have free enterprise dominating things in which case we're going to have massive inequalities of resources on a new space how is this going to flourish what is the flourishment going to look like and then we have the questions technology cannot be developed without politics we need to know how to do this that what's going to happen immediately is how are we going to restrain prison guards in space prisons from exerting psychological pressure on the prisoners of we're going to open the airlock we're going to constantly torture and threaten people with the opening the airlock because it's such an easy way to deprive them of life and so the construction of this Authority on Mars immediately looks either authoritarian fascist or some form a militarism whereby those in positions of authority over those who are imprisoned would have to establish a very strong basis of Rights by which they can't do things except we have no idea what the foundation of that Authority comes from is it God is it the queen is it Martian is it Earth how do we establish those questions what do they look like how do they function if the mission is driven by liberal Society it's going to spread liberal values how does resistance to those liberal values look like we have resistance today when a liberal government implements covid restrictions or lockdowns if the Martians want to be independent and exceptional to Earth it will not lead to a stable and sustainable policy of human flourishing so what we're going to get then is exactly what we have right now which is this idea that we can create a fantasy on this place we don't think about the relationships or the Dynamics the politics of it we just envisioned this Ideal World and that we spend all our time fighting with the fact that this Ideal World never actually functions like that this break this radicalism this rationality that's supposed to underpin this system is based largely on a Cosmopolitan narrative that says that no one will fall back into their old traditional ways nationalist temporary will go away democracy is the true political system as if we don't have these ideas of these civilizations fighting against these these colonization these planetary issues aren't going to reproduce the same problems that we had in the past we have to go abroad we have to make better all cultures and traditions interpenetrate interconnected inter mingle cosmopolitism without provincialism is empty proventilism without Cosmopolitan is is blind the contribution of that colony to humanity will raise ethical economic and legal principles rationalizing the colonies existence that we will have to reckon with and the continuous debate over which public goods should be delivered what's the appropriate level of taxes what's the rule of the free market what's the Socialist who is benefit are we talking about Mankind or Martian kind well inevitably reduce all the problems over and over again it's going to be a grave source of instability throughout the solar system and it cannot be governed properly from the beginning so good luck with that mic drop
 so land is integral to extractivism so your ability to um produce on the land uh I think only five percent of Canada's land is arable most of it's Southwestern Ontario and most of it's being covered with subdivisions um anyways so the removal of resources from the earth for profit which is resource rents or this idea that we can extract these things from it this possession and subordination of the environment to human exploitation game the Dominion of Canada playing on words bolstered by Terror nullus European entitlement rise of capitalism sure um and so extractivism then is the idea of although these forestry mining oil and gas drilling and fracking um fracking uh especially under Obama became so widespread that it became in the first time in American history where they started export oil because they had so much oil that they were getting from fracking uh they have damaged I I don't think you even just need to say indigenous at this point I mean global climate change they've indigenous land food chains and ecosystems um and they destroy not only land but relationships cultures and way of life but if you've I mean we can do this with the tailing pawns from bitumen extraction um even if we deal with everything else they still haven't found sufficient ways to get rid of uh the tailings and what we call tailings is in order to extract bitumen they have to inject large amounts of slurry water with um some other chemicals in order to get the oil extracted from the land but the runoff of that it creates these really toxic pools these ponds that we're not sure how to get rid of it's not quite like nuclear waste because it doesn't have the half-life but it also isn't a solvable problem as easily and so resource extraction problems are this constant source of conflict between indigenous peoples in the Canadian State primarily because I pulled this from the TSX owns website the TSX fully recognizes that 40 of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX Canada is the center of this there is now a growing uh scholarship about Canada's kind of extractivist imperialism around the world because we are the mining company the mining companies are is all Incorporated in Canada why because they have the history and experience of establishing these huge foundations and what's the quickest way to make money find something that doesn't have any cost or a limited cost versus what you can sell it for right and so this is the way in which we do it and these are these are some of the examples of the tailing ponds I don't want to get too much into the Alberta situation is much more complex it's similar to what Saudi Arabia is doing Saudi Arabia is now siphoning off money it gets from oil in order to put it into green energy so they can be carbon neutral Alberta's done a fair amount of recovery from strip mining in order to reproduce the lands and and all the rest of that that's not to say that it's not carbon neutral and that's not to say that it doesn't create other problems but I'm I'm hesitant to to do too much what I will say about extractivism is it provides all sorts of resources right of wealth if you want to look at the largest oil and gas companies I have a friend he's written extensively about this two biggest by market capitalization sectors of the economy in the world are Banking and resource extraction extraction sectors oil and gas Saudi armico Saudi armaco which is doing all that Sports washing by buying up literal sports leagues and sports like Golf and paying for them through the fact that it has these ability to extract huge rents um from energy and oil production so this is a the market cap of these largest oil and gas companies I googled this it took two seconds this isn't hidden information oilprice.com has great information why because extractivism needs to know about all aspects of politics in order to better understand where we're going how we're going and then make money off are they going up or going down so you know we're talking about a market cap of Six Trillion dollars comes from the resource sector it's a highly valuable important sector of the world um and in terms of this the reason why and reason why it's increased in so much significance and importance I just picked you could pick this at any time I just picked I went to our world in data and just picked from the 1930s rather than from 1800s to show even since the 1960s the amount of energy so that's energy that we have tracked extracted from resources and you will look at I mean coal has gone down a bit um there's no economy in the world that's that's off of oil there are green economies that have transitioned to other forms but their cars still run on gasoline and that we don't have enough and this is the next extractive thing the uh the valuable minerals that go into batteries are now the new source of extractivism so even if we shift off the CO2 producing stuff we're still going to participate in extractivism just different forms of extractivism which are going to pull out different things but in terms of this oil gas and natural gas we are still what is called a petroculture civilization I have a chapter in a book on petroculture civilization that that is what we're based on and then we can look at they just blur a can of the us together in terms of CO2 production and then look at sub-Saharan Africa where you simply just don't have it so what we get then as an extractivist economy absolutely is willing to recognize and perhaps even share in the extractivism but extractivism has to continue and so the reason that we're trying to deal with these issues and why we're doing land acknowledgments why the course outline has this at the beginning why we do these intercourse other way we say these things is because we are trying to get to a place where everybody agrees that extractivism should more fairly share the benefits but they're rarely a critique of extractivism itself because 40 of the world's mining companies are in the TSX it's directly linked to the Canadian economy and what the Canadian economy means so we've had efforts in the past to try and fix this problem that these treaties exist Pierre Trudeau uh attempted to do this with a white paper in 1969 thought assimilation was the answer and then it just basically resulted in resistance and mobilization this is what I'm saying I don't really think this is about indigenous identity this this weird this chapter because we're talking about top-down issues right so I just went to Gord Hill so Gord Hill has this book it's comic book I've used in the past um it it exists out there there are copies of it and what he's doing is saying that okay instead of doing the top down framing I'm going to make a comic book to show what it actually looks like and so I didn't I don't want to steal all of his copyright here I want to reference it um and he just documents this this kind of History he went through and documented all the history from um 1942 frameda's Invasion uh Howard zinn's of people's History of the United States if you ever wanted to see how I can't even I can talk about it it will make me too upset to talk about um Columbus's practices of Slaughter and all the rest of that you just go look at the data yourself and I I'm not going to do it it's upsetting to me um and so it's there but it's an invasion part two is framed as a resistance the Inca Insurgency from 1500s to 1780 the uh mapuche um the southern Chile that resisted today the 1680 Pueblo Pueblo Revolt the Pontiac Rebellion if you don't know about these things um listen I don't either I just read the comic book um this is what I'm saying about the kind of the white washing in a literal sense of History because we just jumped to the post-war in this chapter right um I just went through he's got the Seminole Wars uh the Apaches framed as gorillas of the Southwest the war on the plains the war on the coast I cut it off but the um the symbol of the uh the Seattle Seahawks its indigeneity is a long history and tradition about this this fight on the war on the coast no justice on Stolen land assimilation 63 68 Rebellion 68 was a year of worldwide Global protests particularly of students but of also against communism against capitalism it was everywhere and it was also in the Indigenous communities which led to the American Indian movement we have Wounded Knee the Oka crisis the zapatistas this is a 1995 standoff we have 1994 there's Stony Point in relation to Western just down the road from us and then Caledonia is there as well and so Gord Hill is trying to frame this as whoa we have never agreed to Canada we have never agreed to settlement we have constantly fought against settlement and these some of these he documents that British Columbia unseated territories some have just never been seated there's never been a treaty that's covered it we never said it's okay and yet you're still continuing to do it or the treaties have designated the territories and we're defending our rights under those territories and so this idea of developing this indigenous resistance to colonization of the Americas beginning with a Spanish Invasion all the way up to 6 Reclamation of land in 2006 and then Caledonia as well which I would actually was at Caledonia a couple times and this framing of this long tradition I mean I just typed into Shawnee on Tick Tock and this is the first one that came up this idea of invasion as present ation people are here so I mean this idea then of these is specifically this is the six nations in the city around Mohawk I went to high school in Hagersville which literally is on the six Nation reserves the railroad tracks cuts off the the hegersville from the reserve it's literally the other side of the tracks but all of these communities as this is where we are we're very close to all these this is the GTA these communities have been here and have always been here and continue to participate here um this is the the Haldeman tract um that was originally designated as part of the treaty and then the reserve that is on the track near Brantford and so this is very close to London here these are are clear and then the wet sweating which the the textbook talks about I'll talk about we'll bring in a bit is is being tied together and so this is just a map we have these ways on Google Maps now this is the wet sweat and protest sets off a series of blockades of Railways across Canada because wet sweating is this um this um I think I've got it in here maybe it's a bit later maybe I should just skip to it now uh yeah so this is it here is that these Coastal link pipelines are having to go these are all the different indigenous communities they go through or the Trans Mountain pipeline which is explicitly designed to kind of cut through between the territories see it goes right along the boundary lines of different treaties with the wet sweating one the only way to go is go straight through and so as a consequence of that it started these these um these protests that are across the whole country and so it's framing very much this idea of there's the the territory um the ways in which they're the the pipeline is going through the territory and so the argument from gordhill for example is that this is just a long part of uh what we've been doing this whole time we're always protesting and resisting these forms of extractivism um and that this has been constant and ongoing so we get these weird kind of framings of things as being post-war their mobilization is post War when in fact it goes longer than that we have very few formal political organizations because of resources prior to that the white paper sets off all of these rebellions that it unites all of these groups in opposition so it's the practices of the federal government that generate specific targeted responses from communities that have been resisting all this time um you know we have this case in 73 that establishes no no there are collective rights and so the UN drip is so integral because it is the establishment of the fact that these communities have been fighting for rights recognized rights rights for their Community their Nation their peoples um all along and it takes us until the 2010s before we're actually willing to sign a non-binding agreement that recognizes those rights so this isn't in the past this is in your lifetime right this is presentism like we are in the present and so part of the what the white paper triggered was also the effort to try to to deal with all of the problems built into the Constitution about how funding and consultation happens um there's all the problems about how this happens in the 1995 we've got this idea of self-government coming from these territorial claims these building of legal cases and responsibility abilities to doing this and this idea of incentivizing is extinguishment of Rights um we have indigenous leaders coming together defending the Constitution we have continuous kind of efforts against um Golf Course expansion and we could talk about the ecological viability of golf courses in let's say Las Vegas and then we have arrests and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal peoples is produced in 1995 which is a 4 000 page document which clearly outlines the problems and issues which I mean just people don't read right um and so I'll get to this in a bit but we have this in 2000s we have the establishment of of none of it which was largely framed as the conflation of the Inuit with indigenous communities we have Caledonia the opp we have national days of action we have the missing and murdered indigenous women and we have all of these efforts to to establish this tradition this framework of it's not a contemporary issue it's always been an issue it's always going to be an issue it's going to continue which is why reconciliation comes in and we'll talk about this as a way we can't avoid the issue anymore so we have to start dealing with the issue so how do we deal with the issue I've got um uh issues uh you know what let's do it right now I'll just do it now instead because it's good I'll show it twice hello hello first I'd like to remind everyone here to turn off your cell phones before we begin this evening's performance we would like to acknowledge that this theater stands on territory of the initial Bay hold nashoni the Huron wendat and the platoon First Nations we are also mindful of broken covenants and the need to make right with all our relations and now please enjoy the show oh ah sorry hello excuse me um should we um should we go excuse me oh no no I just mean if we're on someone else's land shouldn't we shouldn't we leave oh no no no the the theater is here now we just like to acknowledge whose land it is I'm sorry I'm so confused so if we're on someone else's land shouldn't uh hopefully we'll enjoy the performance oh okay so some of the the money from the ticket sales of the show are going to the indigenous communities well no a portion of them no no the the ticket sales go to the theater so is the money from the bottled water sold here going to the First Nations for clean drinking water or oh no that money goes to Nestle their sponsor I'm so sorry I'm so confused so who's whose land are we on what are we what are we doing it's a dialogue um how are we making right well there's a uh there's there's a plaque you can read in the lobby I'm just I don't understand I'm getting a message from the stage manager that we need to begin the show so please take your seats have a good time but um good night I guess I'll sit down enjoy the show so I think that's an apt representation of the idea of the kind of continuous recognition or non-recognition why does this take so long why are these not set up because we just keep moving on because we can frame present and past as a binary thing and so why don't you just get over the past rather than seeing the ways in which the past is in the present and this legal fiction of recognizing what is already legal without actually resulting in political change is kind of the central problem of recognition
 so I just there's so many of these I mean everybody knows and can understand the issue with we know that it's important but we're struggling to see how it is political right and so let's roll it they asked me to do the land acknowledgment today land acknowledgments I find them so goddamn patronizing you want me to come up here with my feathers and my beads bless your little event tell you you're woke so I said to be delighted what do these land acknowledgments accomplish aside from making white people feel good about themselves I am going to convince you give your land back to the indigenous I swear to God you are first of all very funny second of all you're saying something that a lot of people obviously think right now needs to be said so let's get into this what's the back story behind how this developed we sold tickets to William Shakespeare's as you like it at crows theater and we opened on the Day of Reconciliation we were the only theater open after the pandemic and I come out and do the land acknowledgment and because it is the day of truth of reconciliation the land acknowledgment goes on a little long but I go on and I go on and I go on for 85 minutes and at the end of the show you don't get to see the show that you paid for you you've done a little bait and switch with people there we we did absolutely and everyone was thrilled but you've got it now that was the version that was you've done a new version now that that is just that's out there that's right we're not trying to fool anyone the pure the land acknowledgment we're at the CAA theater this month now when you did it the old way and people realized oh okay I get it I'm not here to see Shakespeare this is actually what it's about what was the reaction um they uh cheered and applauded also they sent nasty letters and and protested in the theater they yelled at me and stormed out we had a whole we had a real acknowledgment of the territory that we're on what'd you make of that reaction it always helps the show because any controversy people come together and they go wow either uh I I feel that way and I'm not going to see that show or I don't feel that way and I'm going to go down and see it so anytime okay anyways we get it uh the kind of performative nature of of what we're doing and how we're doing it and and this so all of this goes back to the UN drip in the recognition so the question is what does this recognition mean and how does it matter how is it political um so there are regions where no territories had been signed where these communities are consistently rebelling or fighting or or putting up challenges to the idea of of this extractivism and so there's this the James Bay and the Northern Quebec agreement in 1975 and The Calder Clays in 73 led to Modern land claims agreement um idea of extinguishing indigenous title in exchange for self-government these really intensified as I showed earlier with Harper between 2006 and 2015. this idea in part because um given the high price of oil and the fact that bitumen development had really come a long way Canada all of a sudden has this this resource this capacity that it wants to be able to utilize in order to provide benefit now how that benefit gets distributed and how that resource gets to Market is the central question because for the existence of Canadian energy production has always been bifurcated between the West and East Coast it's always been dependent on traveling to the U.S for refining because we don't have refining capacity we can extract it but we can't refine it so it has to go to the U.S or it has to go abroad it has to hit the coasts and so in order to hit the coast in these pipelines in order to do pipelines it has to go across many territories and that's always been a problem so this intensification on a maximization of resource extraction creates these these issues both in terms of environmental regulations and the idea that extractivism is okay in 2012 we have this Omnibus Bill that tries to deal with this by revoking all sorts of Environmental Protections narrowing the scope of environmental assessments changing trying to change the Indian Act to lease out Reserve lands to allow extraction no indigenous consultation at all and so the Idle No More came about so it was all this data doesn't matter it's just the idea that you're violating treaty rights with these bills this was a unilateral decision um it it reduced the threshold for surrender of these Reserve lands changes the navigable Water Act tried to remove forms the Education Act to remove the ability of bands to pass bylaws removes the Supreme Court's recognition of matrimonial law allows um non-indigenous to own land on reserves and pose election codes including jail and fines removes computer so it does everything opposite of the UN drip um and so this idea of the UN drip is establishing rights is always this tension between uh we might have the rights but the enforcement of the right still falls on the nation state so what we do get is recognition without this underlying effort to resolve um I pulled this just when the most recent one this is just from the government's website um the Perpetual problem is that many of these communities that don't have infrastructure resources lack things like basic drinking water so we remove Environmental Protections which would demand that you have to have basic drinking water because they've been contaminated with runoff or production or mining or whatever it is that you uses huge amounts of water in order to extract these resources and then those become the thing that result in these communities that don't have developed infrastructure because their reserves and they're often in remote areas because that's where we designated reserves have had long-term uh drinking water advisors that don't have access to clean drinking water and so recognition then is the way to kind of move towards this without actually dealing with the underlying issues the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation committee the implementation of undripped it's really been limited self-government and more delivery there's been some BC is is experimenting with indigenous Healthcare there's lots of different ways that you know I mean BC's seen lots of development actual development on indigenous lands by indigenous um you know Innovation businesses is all the rest of that that's been happening but this idea of full self-determination is still this problem the idea of the Constitution still dictating how we think about these treaty rights the duty to be consulted and accommodated the consultation then what does consultation mean like we're telling you we're going to do this or it doesn't involve a process how is consent achieved and who is it can achieved by is it by the leader in a non-democratic band is it by the Elders of that community and so there's been Lots especially what's sweating lots of debates about who actually gave us Authority and then if there is no consent the government can still act with justification so you know what I mean like if they're still going to act they're still going to act that's the long history of governments agreeing to things and just doing whatever the realities of the experiences on the the ground are are things like lack of access to water and this I've got some I literally have an entire slide deck of just images and memes of the prices of things in in Arctic communities which we haven't even touched on a little bit but Arctic communities face fundamentally different issues of service provision of responsibilities of all the rest of it and then basic things like the cost of food so here's just Tick Tock talking about it recent earthquake look at the brown sugar 17 for partisan Rock brown sugar 40 bucks for bacon buffalo chicken strips of chicken noodles 9.59 there's nothing in there Frozen fruits garbage bags bag liners twenty dollars for burritos 27 for ice cream so the idea here is that the experiences of indigenous communities today right now go on Tick Tock it's called native Tick Tock you can look it up they're all there um talking about the actual experience of indigenous communities is far removed from this idea that we're working towards reconciliation or that we're actually improving the ways in which we do it what we're doing now is just kind of recognizing that we establish these treaties but we're not actually looking at the treaties in terms of what are we supposed to have done and so um Canadian law is much more limited than un drip they should have the right to protection against Integrity right to develop their legal systems fully participate in the cultural life of the state I don't know how you can fully participate when you're paying those prices for food this idea of free prior informed consent means that it should be approved prior to but the Supreme Court has simply not went that way so the lack of meaningful consultation remains an issue it's going to continually be an issue these conflicts are going to be Perpetual issues and it raises these questions about how things that we've agreed to are going to be established and so they just picked this the textbook pixes it's fine the trans pipeline extension it's trying to get the the bitumen to the Pacific coast so there can be ships places to be refined right because we don't have a refining capacity um and so it threatens Wildlife waterways potentially let's be clear all systems fail as soon as you know the any of these pipelines get set up there is going to be a certain level of seepage and spillage it's indefitable the question is to what extent is that part of extractivism and therefore a necessary risk in order to get the reward or is it just a fundamentally no-go we don't believe that we should be doing putting any more money into oil gas exploration and development right um consent wasn't given there's all sorts of resistance and the government is you know purchasing the pipeline using the RCMP to enforce pipelines stopping protests all the rest of this as I showed and so the idea here is that this slow moving process is an ongoing process it's things that exist in reality and that if we're talking about identity I'm not sure we're talking about actual experiences of indigenous identity we're talking about how does settler States come to terms with the existence of indigenous communities that have always been and will always be alongside these mechanisms by which resources are extracted
 so why by way of conclusion I mean it's an oxymoron Canadian history defined by settler colonialism indigenous dispossession and extractivism displacement through coercion treaties being replaced by ongoing Coachmen of indigenous lands extract policies heightened conflicts I don't know if they're heightened that's just a way to frame it as presentism um face these questions ongoing um colonialism as this force in politics is you know prime minister power claiming there is no history of this kind of colonial relationship this framework of U.N drip you know is putting obligations on the state that we're trying to do with things like the knowledgements but I'm not sure it's going to happen I don't even have an iota of a second to deal with policing and how the RCMP and policing and the long history of if you if we know anything about policing in the U.S policing in Canada in terms of imprisonment rates of incarceration of uh likelihood of of encountering with police is quite similar to the U.S in relationship I've got the data I'm just not going to put it here between indigenous communities and policing mechanisms so this I I don't love this video this is in the book I'll just show it and then we'll talk about it a bit and then move on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has offered to withdraw officers from a blocked pipeline service route on First Nations land in Northern British Columbia the RCMP said officers would leave whatsuit in territory if the road remained clear the offer follows two weeks of protests that have blocked construction of the coastal gaslink pipeline through hundreds of miles of an so your protests can only be a protest so long as it doesn't disrupt what kind of protests are non-disruptive that's not protesting that's I guess virtue signaling right isn't that complaining about virtual signaling you're talking about doing things but you're not actually doing things anyways indigenous land on Thursday Canadian officials welcomed rcmp's offer as a significant step toward a more Peaceable Arrangement that would end the blockade which began earlier this month last year the British Columbia Supreme Court granted an injunction to Coastal gaslink that banned any interference with the multi-billion dollar project but in January whatso attend leaders informed the company it was trespassing on First Nations land British Columbia's Government tried to mediate the dispute but talks broke down after a few days protesters began blocking the service road the RCMP then moved in to enforce the injunction and arrested demonstrators the arrest triggered solidarity protests across Canada as well as the Nationwide shutdown of commuter rail Services Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government's working toward finding a negotiated solution that would benefit all parties you remind us rightly so the too often trust has been betrayed in the history of indigenous negotiations with Canadian governments in fact that underlines the difficulty of solving this situation today but our common ground is solving solving solving solving solving our situation today solving the it is framed in terms of a specific problem that needs a specific solution it's not framed in whether or not the problem was created or how it was created or if it's a viable problem to have in the first place the desire to arrive at Solutions we cannot resolve this alone opposition to the coastal gaslink pipeline reportedly dates back to 2012 but it does maintain support from 20 elected First Nations band councils along the Route however wet sweats and hereditary Chiefs say construction cannot proceed without their consent so this is the question I mean these are the questions and we can talk about these in class and how this is thing and I think we went through all of these I made sure to do that and then the unseated lands and consent so um those were all covered um so yes this is a complicated issue that I can't even adequately deal with in one lecture but this is just kind of introduction to the main ideas I do think extractivism is a good way to think about this and settler colonialism as an ongoing practice rather than framed in terms of past it's it's very present it will continue to be present it's not going anywhere
 so sure let's call them disruptive theories I don't know how disruptive they are but sure we can call them disruptive gender analysis maybe but feminism's not just specific to this point in time right um okay so we'll go through these each constructivism post-structuralism and gender analysis um I don't believe in the first I think the second I mean fine it was in the 90s gender analysis absolutely makes sense to me um I say I don't believe in the first because constructivism is normally a method masquerading as a theory um I'll explain how that functions in a second um and so I do think there's a value here in not being so pedantic about how we do some of these things so like if it doesn't fit one of our models it doesn't work okay great because your models didn't explain this collapse of the Soviet Union at all famously there was a realist Journal that published an article um like it was after because the publication time took a while they published an article after the Soviet Union had fallen about how the Soviet Union would continue in for decades right so they didn't explain that neither of those approaches explain that I mean of course the the Marxist approach was implicated in what the Soviets were doing so all three of them were kind of thrown in um and so what we were looking at then are ways in which global politics could be more malleable people and so we like to say the word constructivism but we don't normally think about who's doing construction or how it's constructing and once we ask that question we end up back at those other approaches anyway but neither of you are there um so this is I don't know that the others saw it as an objective reality because marxists don't think it's objective they think it's all class based the realists think everything's conflict based and the Liberals think everything is is inter is mediated by institutions so that's what I mean I I think if you have a constructivist approach you end up using one of those theories anyways but it's it we sure let's say the importance of norms even though in my gender lecture I said the that we should try to be as anti-normative as possible this is the opposite of that problem why I'm not a big fan it's just the idea of creating long-standing and shared expectations about individual State Behavior so that paper I had on the ioc was specifically about norms and it was about how the Olympic movement the olympism movement was trying to create Norms that were confusing and so the the paper I did with a friend of mine was on Norm confusion just the idea that we should be able to to say that this Norm means we should do this but in practice it just means well we're talking about this thing now but we don't know that it actually manifests into outcomes because that requires the politics again so um we can we can see the ways in which states and actors and individuals and groups conceive of themselves differently they can construct new Norms such as things like um a ban on land mines um the idea of not State security but human security or the idea that states shouldn't um just protect themselves they should protect people the responsibility to protect um so we have a bunch of those I would say that another way to talk about Norms is the idea of of buzzwords they function like this they allow broad normative agreement on issues so we all said we want more participation but we don't know what it means we all want more empowerment but of who I don't know if we want empowerment of everybody that Civil Society should matter okay but which actors and what if the two actors in Civil Society are fighting on two sides of things poverty reduction great how and voices of the poor should count okay in what and so this idea then is that Norms allow us to agree but they don't necessarily tell us what to do and to do we need one of those approaches again so that's why I'm saying it's a method in search of a theory right um and so the shift from government as the responsible actor to governance is part of this so institutions now famously the bank of international settlements is a normative institution it technically has no capacity to do anything it uses each of the states coming together they meet all the heads of the Central Bank meet and say this is what we will do but it doesn't Force any state to do anything it just is a site of agreement so it's an example of governance but it doesn't manifest any form of government right it doesn't even it's not an institution per se it's just a kind of like meeting place and so like the G7 and G20 they get together and they do governance but there's no effort to establish a president of the the G7 that rules all the G7 members right so it becomes we become focused on normative questions on this feel-good rhetoric rather than using coercion Force institutions we want to have empowering changing ideas and minds but it's not at all clear what the ways in which we can do that so this is a a great video of this um it follows this Fabian socialist principle of the United Nations that these are real problems and I don't deny in any way that they aren't real problems we're just not clear on who is going to provide the solutions and so this gets me every time I'll probably cry I have a daughter it it just gets me this girl effect but look at how it builds your normative consensus but it doesn't tell you specifically how you're going to go about it and who's going to be responsible for doing it so this is a good example of kind of buzzword symbolism foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] reconstructed [Music] thank you [Music] thank you doesn't even say who it's from so it's it really is good because it doesn't say who it's from and then listen we can 100 agree on that so we have a constructed way in which we think about things we reconstruct it in order to produce a solution but what does that solution look like so let's say we we I mean you ask the Marxist just tax the billionaires give to the girl okay fine the Liberals are much more complicated so one we want to increase funding to those institutions but we don't know in our current institutional system if a a state like Saudi Arabia would want to undertake those mechanisms so we don't have any liberalism just says cooperate but what if somebody doesn't want to right what if you're doing with the Nazis or something How would how would you encounter that um then we would have the issue of the the kind of realist they don't have a whole lot to say about this because it's not state-based you could try to overthrow the state in which this stuff is happening but we don't know that that's going to produce an outcome that's going to be useful here so we clearly do need another approach this is why we need feminism because those approaches fails but we don't know the constructivism just making us change things it's going to do it because what all it's really doing is it's producing this idea of challenging the status quo with a new form of inclusivity so we all need to care about the girl effect we need to focus on the girl child as this mechanism of social change and by doing that you become the expert you can start organizations like a meet away and say we are going to do this and then you get all this resources and capabilities but it's not at all clear like if the state where this is happening is saying no outside interference States will best explain the situation and so we are trying to convince those State leaders that this matters and so we are trying to convince them constructed in their mind tell them the importance of this but the problem is is that this follows a pattern that we've seen before and a lack of theory of colonialism leads to this idea that we can just spread Norms that we innovate and develop in the west onto other context cultures and situations and tell them the way that they're doing their context culture and situation is wrong what is the appropriate age to have a kid I agree with them it's not though at that age but it just says when she's ready so what if different societies disagree on when that is right and so the problem here is that this reproduces the idea that this kind of myth of broad public support needed in order to create policy change but we don't know what the broad public supports policy change is going to look like it's this idea of thinking or feeling first and so development myths work through emotional identification not through rationality they build and sustain the feeling of conviction that people need in order to act good argument has its place but it's secondary to something else the feeling of rightness backed by normative instruments like the Millennium development goals which serve the ceremonial function of bolstering togetherness and purposefulness to strive to a Visionary goal those are all normative agreements but we don't know that those normative agreements don't require the theories in order to accomplish the goals all we know is that we've got normative agreements
 so this leads us to the gender analysis in IR um there's a book by Patrice Patrick Thaddeus Jackson called the conduct of inquiry and international relations that argues that feminism is the most coherent international relations approach because it provides like Marxism a coherent vision of the world like realism it explains violence and like liberalism explains why we should try to stop violence so um there are many different gender analyzes in in IR there isn't a coherent singular way to do it the international Journal of feminist studies is quite good on this stuff gender absolutely is a power relation and then Society privileges certain relationships to masculinity ideas and masculinity who possesses masculinity and what types of things they should be we've talked about this with the gender stuff I've got more than enough in the glossary that deals with this and devalues those forms of femininity again I don't love the gender binary it's also a process gender is social construction femininity metamasculine deviant sexuality again we talked about this um man I wouldn't have used that language but anyways um sexual violence award time or Advance against women is more appropriate and so the idea here is that um all of these will matter and there's a gender development index and there's lots of different ways to to do this um it can draw issue attention to issues such as the gender division of labor gender violence intersections of gender-based class normal stuff we talked about all this gender stuff it just does it at the international level um I'll provide an example here so I mentioned it earlier in the gender week um this is the reference to it um this uh was the argument of uh one of the ward 7 counselors in Hamilton that said as a woman when I have my period I would be stocked these things at home before I went out when I was prepared as a woman I was always prepared so I cannot support an effort to make menstrual products uh broadly and freely available in public spaces okay um I find a little bit uncomfortable that we're talking about this for an hour and a half um it's a stigma attached to menstruating she said it's natural body of function if it's private matter we can't uh talk about it this type of stuff matters this former student of mine um who pushed and now London does provide menstrual products in public spaces all of this comes from this type of work about how we have and this is what the international relations approach can do it can do like this textbook does go from the abstract to the specific but in ways that that matter and so this is a key aspect of gender equality because menstruation is part of healthy fertility this is in in women this can be an average of 3000 days per Life one quarter of the global population at any time that we simply do not talk about that even the human rights mechanisms did not talk about until the 2000s um and so this is the framing this is the ways in which femininity is devalued or degraded in ways in which we don't celebrate the thing by which we are here from in one way shape or form uh because you have to be here somebody had to go through the process of birth for you to be here I don't think we have fully artificial uteruses yet and that's the hashtag male pregnant then then I can do it then I can carry a baby to turn but until then we can't do that so we've got lots of examples of ways in which just basic things like this is a quarter the global population at any time is dealing with this and yet to this day we still decrease the confidence the liking sit further away this idea that um somehow you're less confident I'm an actress and today I'm going out into the Streets of London to discover how ordinary people react to an instant involving tampons we'll see how it goes I'm so sorry that's rather embarrassing we'll never see you again [Music] thank you guys sorry guys one quarter of the world's population are any time but it's still framed in this very specific way so we have a lot of unease about discussing it um one of the things that International feminist activism has focused on is specifically around human rights mechanisms is dealing with this and so we have all the different ways in which these euphemisms function as forms of reproducing this that simple lack of access to materials is a persistent problem the fact that the lack of access to materials means that you have to use all these other things is a way in which this is a Perpetual issue so this has direct educational impacts all over the world on a regular basis and so it is all these issues this is just in the article what would magically if men could menstruate and women could not menstruation would become enviable worthy masculine event men would brag about how long and how much Congress would fund a National Institute of uh just Memoria I can't can't pronounce that to Stamp Out monthly discomfort sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free and so this in general in India for example costs about five days a month of loss of education for the girl child around the world um we we know that there are all sorts of correlations to reproductive attract infections and health problems but we don't study the issue because we don't talk about the issue there are additional problems outside the home um uh as it intersects with ability and disability um uh women wait on average seven years before seeking medical help and then homeless women informal settlements refugee camps prisoners women with disabilities sex workers all have to encounter these issues and so it becomes a human rights concern one that nobody talks about counselors in Hamilton about being on the streets is probably being a female if you're a woman you like your face clean you know you like feeling good smelling good yeah period times are not good times for us Hi how are you it is very difficult to have your period and very uncomfortable every day I wake up and I do my daily routine because nobody wants to smell you know and that's that's kind of a big deal out here I've been doing this for so long I'm 27 years old this will be my eighth winner out here straight we had a pretty rough childhood growing up my mom was a victim of domestic violence and so she put us through a lot I went into the system she got custody of me again and basically she was like you know what I don't want you in the system anymore but you can't be here I hadn't lived at home since I was you know 10 years old you know and I took care of myself there was no keeping me home anyway you know whether she if she wanted to or not there's so many kids that it's like they fall through the cracks I guess priority this is then you know be full this is not a poor issue this is not just about getting products to those who need them which is obviously a priority this is really about bringing dignity to women I tend to flock to places like this which is like public parks where they have public bathrooms I come here to Thompson Square Park and I do my my Cleanup in the in the sink I get a big cap like like the big McDonald's cup and um I fill it up with water I'll actually like I'll straddle it this way you're able to you know pour water and you know use the soap and um and basically wash over the toilet and get a really good cleansing at the same time that's the best so this is the problem and this is in no way unique to homeless uh individuals are unhoused I think we're supposed to say now in language um but very few countries have any type of water sanity Water Sanitation and hygiene programs um wash programs and if they do um two percent of it's on hygiene promotion in the Beijing platform for Action in 1995 reproductive health and Sexual Health sexual education was mentioned but there was no explicit uh reference to menstrual hygiene there are no human rights mechanisms to deal with it but we do have a human rights mechanisms of the rights of the the ability of men to shave when they are imprisoned or prisons prisoners of War there's no reference to menstruation at all the Human Rights Council did not acknowledge it until 2014. it wasn't even mentioned as an issue and so a lot of what we think about when we're talking about policy and these type of things is the structure it has to be so deeply structured in all of our lives that we both find it uncomfortable to talk about that we don't talk about we don't think it's political we think it's private and yet the like more than almost any other issue it is something that people are dealing with on a daily basis around the world and yet we have no mechanisms no language no ways of thinking or dealing with it so it directly confronts human dignity it's not even clear that we need to have the stigma around it it's something that we we have even mechanisms like the convention on the elimination all forms of discrimination against women it's not really useful here because this is specifically to menstruating bodies it is specific to them and so those bodies need these resources and yet we don't have any mechanisms to deal with this and so it's interesting to think about the ways in which putting this as as Central to a political aim is the effort to take it and and create human rights in a kind of practical way at the international level because we have the human right to health human right to water human right to sanitation but we need something like a human right to access to materials to absorb blood during menstruation and so hygiene facilities and services need to be culturally acceptable which means we have to have States distinguish what it is they need we need to have different options available based on what preferences are and capabilities are and likelihood of of you know what is the most culturally appropriate or appropriate for that person and then you have to have access to water and Disposal Services so this is a massive issue that impacts millions and millions of people and yet we have no mechanisms internationally to deal with it everything is put back to the state and the state is largely framed through these Notions about you know taboo and it's largely dominated by men and so this becomes this issue of where should this fit because it doesn't seem to fit in those three dominant approaches it's not just a norm issue because it can't be uniform and we need to actually do the work to break some of the taboos and the men in charge in order to make this a priority or issue and then how do we override those cultural norms some of the they are and so this idea of this being an issue it's a human rights issue and again it's one that everyone benefits from making sure that everybody has access to resources to dignity and to education is human rights and so it's not clear that this is even fully one issue for a group or for women or for men or whatever it's it's everybody's issue right that we need to protect this ways in which we can do things but then if culture is the impediment to the this right do we need to override culture in order to do this so it raises these these interesting kind of feminist questions that we can come back to about all these competing perspectives and the ways in which we kind of have to work them together um we didn't talk about the coveted pandemic very much because I don't think it's as relevant each theory has different ways of dealing with things um you know we can talk about the ways in which you know realism kind of deals it's not a state security issue we do have a bit of blaming each other I don't think anything was rising to the levels of of conflict um liberalism yes cooperation institutions in the who I mean we the Liberals believe we should use the who but they weren't really well prepared for the criticisms of it um yeah I mean that's pretty weak that's some weak sauce um rethinking of norms around travel trade borders and immigration sure that's going to happen but it'll go away to whenever the next thing happens we'll forget about the last thing post-structuralism mobilizing a discourse fighting or mobilizing the discourse and saying it's not a real thing right like that was Trump right like just didn't believe he had it didn't didn't believe in it could do that stuff like you can if you have resources you can deny reality right um and then the gender analysis that the impact on on women and and um well in fact on everybody that these issues relate to us all so this is a the kind of the different approaches the different ways and I tried to bring in examples for each of those approaches to talk about the ways in which we need to think about what those theories contribute and how they can help us think about these things
 so if we have realism as a system of Anarchy we have liberalism um as a kind of offshoot of how we think about they overlap with domestic forms of liberalism um but they're a little bit different um primarily this is because individualism as a principle is something we we want to explain but we have to do it through things and so individuals always are kind of embedded in interdependent framework of the institutions in which they act and so this idea then is that um people or individuals so like human rights Target humans as individuals rather than saying that human rights come from the state and therefore it's up to State up to the state to ensure or that we put the primary responsibility we we do in terms of action but not in terms of theory right we say individuals have rights and so this is the the premise here um and so individuals choose to cooperate and they want to achieve gains and peace in the international Arena so unlike focusing on states which we are kind of a an artificial created body that like you have a prime minister or a President Who changes but they're still the leaders of that state we treat the state as the same um we have here the idea that individual actors do matter and that individuals have different characteristics and institutions reflect different values and ideas they're not all the same I was trying to find a good example of individualism individualism has its own weird Notions about it it as well individualism still situates things as cooperation but is always resistant to um famously their uh Hadley bull has this theory of an international society that somehow well if we're all individuals we must be in a global Society or globalism or cosmopolitanism but in general individualism um resists that so I used to have a conservative Senator come into classes before covid and he he would always say the individual is the most prosecuted um a group in human history I'm like well I mean maybe but that's a clear like oversimplification of the experience so this was just an example example of kind of hyper individual Alaska again Chachi PT recommended this I've never seen this movie I'm gonna be all the way out there all the way  out there just on my own you know no no watch no map no tax no nothing no nothing just be out there just be out there in it you know big mountains rivers sky games be out there in it you know in the wild what are you doing when we're there now you're in the wild you're just living man you're just there in that moment in that special place in time yeah maybe when I get back I can I can I can write a book about my travels I know about getting out of this sick Society Society Society you know Society because you know what I don't understand I don't understand why people why every  person is so bad to each other so often it doesn't make sense to me judgment control all that the whole Spectrum let's just what people we talking about carrots okay so that is American masculine Frontier idealism um this idea that the individual is is an island and that um there are all these systems trying to control the individual and the individual is oppressed right um so the idea here is that if we if we are individuals then we make choices and that reason dictates outcomes more than Anarchy Anarchy says like if you're a small state you don't have any say the matter right you're just positioned to try to constantly maximize your gains and minimize the likelihood that you're going to get wiped out whereas this says that no if the individual is the center of the system we can make reasonable choices and choose the best systems that reinforce the value of the individual and so that's the premise of of both interdependence and democratization right at the international level we have this it's a truism because it's not accurate in that there's counterfactual examples all over the case there's I can disprove it very easily in many cases but in general in the kind of broadest sense democracies don't go to war with one another and so what this means is that the the valorization of the individual and the right to vote in a democracy makes those democracies less than likely to attack other democracies because they also value individuals right um yeah that whether or not it has produced better outcomes could raise questions I don't know if we think democracy online has led to better like the comments section um is democratic and I don't know that that leads to better outcomes but this is the theory right it's why it's an incomplete Theory it's a myth it's a story it's one we tell because absolutely you can understand people choose to enter into relationships where they're not dominated by their parents God that's so embarrassing they're not dominated by other actors and so they choose and those that choice reflects forms of interdependence and it creates institution it builds relationships and so those types of relationships that are chosen are better than ones that you're forced into because of power relations and so it valorizes the individual and reason as choosing the best possible path so it has that natural teleology that I've been talking about throughout the course in it the idea that we are moving towards greater and greater systems controlled by realist thinking that is going to be Progressive because everyone's going to understand through reason the value of what it is they're trying to achieve we're moving away from more we're moving towards peace we're moving away from conflict towards cooperation the problem of course is that this is an is type of idealism it tends to hold up this premise that cooperation produces better outcomes even in the face of actors that are bad because it says if you've got an Iran or you've got a North Korea you should still try to integrate them into the system because over time that integration will lead to them adopting those values that interaction with others and the reason with others they will follow reasonable arguments and reasonable benefits over time primarily because you get this Collective action issue so if you're all small states and you all get together and you're the majority and there's only one bad actor one big actor out there they can no longer threaten your survival because you've entered into a system of interdependent cooperation and so this really reinforces the idea of of creating things so create a regime a framework that you can all agree on create an institution a a you know International atomic energy agency something that everybody agrees that if you've got nuclear weapons they have to be inspected and Norms the idea that you're going to follow each other and and produce the best action so one of the underlying premises of this system and I've written about this before is that olympism is actually framed as a social movement the thing that goes in the Olympics and it stems from this liberal system it actually predates the United Nations it was this form of the idea that if we could all get together at the same place and cooperate on anything doesn't matter what it would bring us closer together and make us more likely to follow the regimes norms and institutions of a good actor and so Sport and the Olympics in particular is seen as peaceful because it is a tie time there is a thing called the Olympic truce where the both sides will put down their their weapons in order to participate in the sport and so this is the idea of Peace stemming from reasonable action of cooperation now in the current moment we have seen this framework of olympism as a social movement be undermined progressively by the idea of sports washing that more and more regimes like Russia and Sochi or Saudi Arabia or Qatar are using sport to legitimate themselves build their Norms institution of regime access by utilizing sport where they don't have to actually change and so the question that stems from this is does Sport bring us together or drive us apart and so this is one of the kind of famous examples of the problems of framing things in these way during that period of time the word would be Carnival as U.S Sprinter Marty Glickman remembers it the view was grabbed for those two weeks in August of 1936 as Berlin hosted the world's greatest athletes for the 11th Olympic Games International visitors were warmly welcomed but behind the pump and pageantry were ominous signs the swastika was all over on virtually every other Banner we saw there was a swastika the benefit of hindsight and history helps us see these were more than just games these weren't the Berlin Olympics these were the Nazi Olympics they were also an opportunity for the regime to create the illusion of a new Germany on the world stage but the reality was quite different Jews were excluded from all German sports teams and clubs but the Nazis put Jewish International track and field star Gretel Bergman on the Olympic roster to fend off International critics removed from the German team at the last minute Margaret Lambert as she is now known recalls her reaction I would have been a loser either way because had I won there would have been such a an insult against the German psyche how can the a Jew be good enough to win the Olympics that I would have had to be afraid for my life I'm sure and had I lost I would have been made as a a joke off the field the truth about what the Nazis were doing was hard to miss many Americans could open their newspapers and on the front page they could see stories about what was going on in Nazi Germany so it certainly wasn't a secret by 1936 Germany's Jews and other minorities had been stripped of their civil rights even their citizenship and the Nazi regime had already opened its first concentration camps everybody knew everybody knew early on exactly the kind of regime Nazi Germany was so much so that for the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games there was talk about boycotting these games the debate raged they're all trying to decide what to do should they go did that mean that they would be somehow putting a stamp of approval on a regime that many people felt was abhorrent or was it just a sporting contest so this is so when we talk about like stick to sports this has always been attention in sports and international competition because of the liberal belief that they're not doing any harm by platforming these these societies because they will move towards the reason of the liberal premise right that that's that's what we we should do everyone's moving towards liberalism because it's a reasonable and right thing to do and these institutions engender the idea of cooperation clearly that wasn't the case here and in fact it can do the opposite because it legitimates those things I've got pictures of you know there were Nazi rallies in in Madison Square Gardens back in the 30s like this stuff also legitimates those regimes and so it cuts both ways right this idea of interdependence is supposed to make us more um likely to be like one another right so democracies don't fight each other um economies that cooperate General don't want to go to war with each other and the more that I can access the tourism and trade of another country the more I'm going to understand them and be less hostile towards them in theory but this idea of deepening free markets and and freedom in the political sphere is is an effort to persuade and cooperate using these common values and ideas which just I mean we've had almost 100 Years of preparation now maybe these regimes have figured out ways around it and so these International institutions are supposed to be the the common interests and show the the benefit of the liberal system of cooperation I don't know if the public goods created by reasonable States so part of what liberalism does as well is it also convinces the U.S that it should pay for these things so the U.S still continues to be a large part the largest contributor to the United Nations even as it criticizes and attacks it because it set up these institutions this is what's called embedded liberalism we embedded liberalism in these institutions because we believed in the value of those institutions and that anybody should be able to access them even those states that aren't liberal and so we're trying to achieve common interests through cooperation this was perceived as part of the failure of the interwar period that the interwar period led to fighting it led to the rise of Nazi Germany that the um the punishment after after World War One of demanding reparations for the cause of World War One LED to this interwar period that led to the rise of the Nazis this is the perception and so therefore as a consequence of that liberals believe we need to create strong central institutions to stop this from happening again we need to have a bank that is going to redevelop and not punish those who fought in the War we need to have a system of currency pegged to the American dollar that everybody can follow and we'll use a thing called the international monetary fund to make sure that those states can keep pegs to the U.S dollar so that we don't have anybody like trying to cheat each other on currency differences and then finally we'll have a liberal trading regime a World Trade Organization which will constantly establish more and more trade agreements to make sure that that we increasingly cooperate and we try to reduce tariffs so that nobody can punish Goods coming from another state everybody can trade freely and so this is seen as a parallel of well we have rules of law domestically so we'll establish rules of law internationally these institutions I I'd like to think of them when I teach the United Nations course I I'd frame International institutions as platforms the embedded character of the platforms um there's a couple uh articles written about this but it's the idea that the embedded character of the platforms these embedded liberal character means that it doesn't really matter what you do as long as you do it there right so as long as you use that platform it's effective like and we can see this with social media today we're like whatever the platforms everybody is on is the one people are going to use so even if we don't like the way that things are going in that platform until we've figured out a new one we're not going to use anything else because it's where everybody is so the League of Nations was the first efforts to establish a platform it failed because it said attack against one is attack against all and that just didn't happen right it over and over again States kept attacking each other and nobody responded so it failed so when they created the UN they said okay what we're going to do in this system is have a a relief valve that says the biggest most powerful actors who set this thing up will also have a veto power over any other State's intervention and so if there's no agreement there's no action so it is a platform where if you're going to go fight about an issue you're gonna go to the security Council and you're going to get your way famously the Soviets abstained during the Korean War and they realized quickly we are never abstaining again we're going to use our veto because if we abstain then that just lets the under the it was under you know mash and the intervention in the Korean War was under a U.N auspice because the Soviets abstained from the decision and that let everybody else say let's go into Korea and it didn't produce an outcome that anybody wanted so after that they were like if there's no agreement we're not doing interventions and so liberalism sees IR as more complex and multifaceted than realism this also brings us back to the thing that we started the chapter with which is the NATO intervention so the NATO intervention was an explicit effort to go around the UN because there wasn't any agreement at the U.N that this intervention should happen and they targeted that one specific regime so the NATO intervention then as a military intervention breeds the idea that realism is right and despite all of this rhetoric liberalism was wrong and that the states who championed liberalism still use realism when it's in their interest to do so this is why they're overlapping theories they help explain the same events in different ways and so this is this is the question I have and and it's just the idea of like whatever platform you're on is where you're going to have your discussions where you're going to make your decisions and that's where it's going to happen and as long as you're using it that's it and in the absence of something else it's going to be the successful one but this idea of having other mechanisms not a lot I mean you're in NATO or not and we're not sure that we want NATO policing the International System because we still think at least the UN system there is a possibility that other states can can veto what what is happening there so this idea of liberalism as an embedded institution or as a form of embedded individual rational cooperation is still how we frame the system it's the dominant framework that the International System Works under today
 okay Welcome to our discussion of international relations um I was the director of the international relations or IR program um for I guess about seven or eight years um until just recently um so the international relations program deals with this realm of politics so that's what my degree was in it was actually an international political economy in East Asian studies that's what I got my degree in and I did my dissertation on protest movements in around trade agreements in Seoul South Korea and Toronto okay so um we are going to identify this idea of what makes the international separate from kind of domestic politics Will distinguish between international relations and um Global the global politics so or what happens at the global level we'll review three theoretical approaches um I'm going to add in some of my own examples I don't feel that there's I I actually don't even know what marxian is it's a weird expression it feels to me like somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about writing about it so I bring in my own examples on that and then these three kind of disruptive theories constructivism post structuralism and gender analysis again I don't really feel we have a good clear examples so I'll bring in my own examples uh to supplement the textbook and then we'll talk about a little bit about this idea of ir Theory and covid but not much right um again because I think we're all coveted out at this point okay um so when we when we talk about political events or how we think about political contestation so if if in political science we can test all ideas when it comes to the international realm when we can test ideas we're doing so in ways that are often much broader in scope so for example if we um this if we want to analyze something like the ways in which NATO intervenes to get rid of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in 2011. Conflict here isn't just between different actors or different groups in society it's now a whole bunch of different actors across societies getting together to intervene and so when we talk about IR theories or different approaches um we're talking about the specific ways we can understand those events so how do U.S Britain France and Canada get involved in overthrowing a regime in Libya right um why do they do that how do they do that and how is that contestation theorized is it the same as the Internationals or as the domestic system where there's a single actor who gets to decide who is a legitimate speaker and has the legitimate use of the Monopoly of violence no and we'll talk about why that is and so part of the reason that it isn't the same is that the cooperation that takes place generally between societies is boar so when you're talking about the cooperation in a in a domestic realm between different groups it's normally just seen as social conflict political protest social contestation sometimes Civil War but on the international level it's often just straight Warfare so the international then isn't everything that is global because it's not necessarily things that are international so in Canada we have an indigenous French and an English tradition we could frame that as International they're different nationalities that are interacting and to some extent prior to 1648 um this actually was how Affairs took place we didn't have established States so much of what we saw even Athenian city-states and things like that where where interactions between different groups but that's generally not what we mean when we say International because it's it's distinct and I'll talk about why that is um we also um aren't really talking about geopolitics we'll get into that a bit more when we talk about order geopolitics is things like the idea of an Empire or um setting up uh the Cold War into camps where certain um geographical based conflicts happen and we're strategically valuing things like resources and capacities and those type of things and then um we'll talk about globalization a bit as the idea of the global and we're not sure so States absolutely facilitate globalization but they also kind of resist globalization I teach the global competition rise of Asia course which used to be called globalization so um that course we look at the ways in which this the different theories about globalization happen and there is a subset an examination of of relations that are called globalization that don't fully fall into what we call international relations so the problem is basically scale right um when we think about things at a at a domestic level we can talk about well we know who the Supreme Court is we probably know who the Monarch the ruler or the the Prime Minister President is and we probably know that the laws passed stem from this long tradition you know of this idea of either in the in the British tradition that's common law or we've got this constitutional law in the U.S there's some foundation for that but at the international level it's totally different because there is no like overriding Authority that can set everything for everybody because nobody agrees on anything where they all have different societies different Traditions different cultures different understanding and so things like Law and Order and policy even ideas aren't the same at the global level as they are at this the state level and so we have to explain these things and we can have these Frameworks and this is the key thing similar to when we talk about politics it these are not exhaustive Frameworks um and so like in in Natural Science theories we would try to explain something with in terms of causality um we can do correlation in political science we can't really do causality because there are overlapping events and issues taking place that have different forms of correlation so if we want to talk about the ways in which capitalist exploitation takes place we have to use a framework that talks about that whereas if we want to talk about Interstate conflict we have to use a framework that talks about that they're distinct theories and so the the we call them dominant theories I don't know that marxian theories maybe is the same as liberal and realistic there's a lot of term confusion here but whatever um and then these disruptive theories these Challengers again I'm not totally convinced but sure let's go with it um and then this idea of covet impacting I are actually I I don't agree even a little bit with this what I think we saw with kovid was like the black lives matters protests um the idea then that this highlights the ways in which other issues haven't been addressed and they come to the fore so we have things like global climate change decolonization anti-racist Reckoning they're more significant and have more impact on how we think about IR than covet did the closest would be that kovid provided some idea that there could be Global events and therefore we have to start thinking global climate change like the next Global event but the problem of the levels of analysis and why we do international relations distinct from regular political analysis is primarily because it's famously called two level games you can be a great well-respected leader like internationally Marcon or macron or Justin Trudeau um are are perceived of as like good International leaders but domestically they get all sorts of uh criticism or and the other ways like Trump could have at least some clear support domestically um that allows him to do things but internationally he's got none and so we need to be able to explain those differences um in some type of framework and so we have this tension all the time between that which is is um the perceptions that happen around the world and then the Frameworks that can explain what's happening and so we have this this problem when I say I I will say IR over and over again it's my own tacit um bias towards the expertise of of this field right it's a way of of being exclusive about the ways that we think about things so when I say IR I mean this is what I'm talking about versus other fields because they'll have their own reference points in the ways in which they do things and so IR then sees the world as largely bound or the the kind of foil that we were reflect on is the power of the nation-state either that it's powerful or not powerful enough right one way or the other um and so this will come back to we'll come back to in the next video is the question of structural Anarchy so you know no matter how many criticisms we have of whatever state we're in whether it's the North Korean state or whether it's Chinese state or whether Canadian State we still have a referent point over and over again that someone is in charge right we might not like that they're in charge we might really like that they're in charge but someone is in charge at the international level that's doesn't function it's we it's structural Anarchy we don't have agreement that one actor is in charge in fact there's lots of efforts by other actors to say that person shouldn't be in charge I'm going to form my own Alliance to make sure that person isn't in charge and so what we're doing then is we're trying to understand the ways in which what happens at the domestic level when it it jumps up to the international level to what extent those theories are the same or to what extent we need new models so global politics then which you'll often see mood around isn't the same as as IR it's a broader and more inclusive term it includes more actors the role of non-state actors gender class race all of those things will come in um settler colonialism right is largely absent from this state-centric Theory it can it can have a role in decolonization decolonization movements and efforts to challenge kind of racist ways in which we think about the world and so global politics then has this relationship then between those two levels so all throughout this this book we've been talking about kind of the global impacting the very local global global global local so international relations is trying to go in between global politics and domestic politics kind of fit in the middle and so it's this this constant kind of question about which level it is and so this is a classic this is Mir shimer he's a very I guess we would say conservative classical realist none of us could understand the world we live in or make Intelligent Decisions without theories indeed all students and practitioners of international politics rely on theories to comprehend their surroundings some are aware of it some are not some admit it some do not but there's no escaping the fact that we cannot make sense of the complex world around us without simplifying theories Maybe so this isn't I mean it is Theory like traditional theory it's theory in the ways in which we Define um a framework that we are going to study and how we're going to study that framework and then what that framework will tell us about what it is we're studying so um it's not like a universal theory of gravity that postulates something for all time well it kind of does but postulate something that we can demonstratively uh prove one way or the other that's never going to happen you're going to have evidence that fits your theory and you can have evidence that doesn't fit your theory and then you're gonna have different groups that are fighting about whether or not that evidence fits your theory this is just parsimony simplifying things so all these simplifying theories are telling stories and they're incomplete stories necessarily in complete stories but they um capture that by saying they are a theory and so it's not theory in the kind of true abstract sense it's it's this claim that we have to kind of deal with stuff at the international level and so we're we have a complex situation we're going to simplify it that simplification has all sorts of violence right because a lot of these theories just never included race in their Theory at all so the Journal of race development um that's how we used to conceptualize things just became the journal Foreign Affairs and just doesn't mention there or didn't mention for the longest time that it used to be framed in those terms and so these theories also do all sorts of harm but it's inevitable because they're oversimplifying they can't be complex multifaceted open system theories because they wouldn't be able to explain anything so we are going to try to explain things we're going to decide what matters and what doesn't so we're going to say either we're because we're fighting for the status quo so we are saying that the system we have is good we've got to fight for these institutions the UN matters all the rest of this or we can say you know the liberal order is crumbling we have Challengers all over the world who aren't adopting these liberal premise liberalism has not resulted in enough net benefit for the rest of the world they are challenging these claims and so it's the idea that you're either for a status quo or for a challenger position and so this is uh um Robert Cox's favorite famous Proclamation that the study of global politics and the analysis of international relations Is inherently political it's always for someone and for some purpose so these theories themselves are contested we don't agree on them they're not complete but they tell a story that helps us make sense of the world and so when we look at events we can decide whether or not those events are ones that we consider important
 so marxian Theory I I mean okay listen the the the marxists love to fight each other more than they love to fight any perceived enemy so I I take it as as given that there's lots of different um ways in which we can do this um it is less influential in certain ways compared to realism and liberalism so one of those experiences um that was talked about in the last video in the context of olympism was that the appeasement of the Nazis in the interwar period is what immediately led the realists to and including some of the the intellectual Jews who fled Europe to the U.S to argue that we have to be in terms of self-help and we have to be realistic so consequently the Americans are very realist um and liberal at the same time the rest of the world tends to be more liberal and some form of either marxists so there's a British tradition there's um all sorts of collective security schools in Europe and all the rest of that some form of not just liberalism or realism so this is very we want to stay abstract but they reflect the ideas they reflect the additives and opinions of those that have them so less influential in the U.S 100 the rest of the world less so uh depends where it honestly depends where um there are four there are different perspectives within this but fourth key themes uh reality as a totality I don't know I mean I don't know Marxist that wouldn't say that that's stupid and crass material is a bit object to it but whatever okay so the idea here is that um we have to conceptualize everything as a whole right um we have to we have to think about systems as coercion and consent as governed governing and govern that there is contestation inherent to the system you could call it class struggle you can call it struggle over social reproduction you can call it um whatever framework you want dependency whatever the idea here is that there are relations and processes um transmission belts of ideas that go back and forth between society and Elites Elites in society it has a materialist conception of History so it's more concerned with like how things happen and that it also frames itself in terms of emancipatory political project we need to fix these problems um and so uh I don't know who this capitalist totality is we did that stuff in the 70s maybe Andre Gunda Frank used to be at UT but he died in the 90s I don't know who this is and if you don't name names I don't trust you um as I've said throughout this course so Global political economy so the gpe I pulled that from our our um our uh chapters going forward because that chapter is so dry I I just don't think it would be useful for any of us um I wonder this is one of those the sleight of hand tricks that I've talked about throughout in the textbook when you don't really know what you want to do or you don't want to platform it or be accused of platforming it I guess you just make it sound really boring right the core accumulates profit by exploiting the periphery I mean okay David Harvey is argued against this for ages and ages it's just simply not true since 2000 like with Empire heart negri's Empire no one has asserted this but whatever we'll we'll say this International struggle is the relation between unequal social force is great I mean what isn't the goal is empowerment emancipation a global working class is there still a global working pass the end of exploitation through Revolution I'm sure uh challenges the status quo dominance interest and influential theories of fire this is such a crappy summary I just couldn't let it stand um so I'm going to do a pop culture reading of of Marxism Marxism is successful and popular and persists uh not because it is true but because the experiences of people are reflected in the ways that we think about things I could literally teach Marxism with memes it's not that hard I'll do it right now so this idea of like reducing these really abstract concepts with no specifics I think does a disservice to both our thinking about these things and our understanding just generally right here's an example billionaires we can talk about billionaires it's materialist it's about a holistic system the billionaires they have to get their money from somewhere everybody else has contributed systems they're creating and it it speaks to massive inequality and maybe forms of exploitation so why not use a simple example here this comes a friend of mine actually the best man at my wedding um uh wrote a book on Pluto the plutocracy and this one percent um and he just was doing numbers analysis because this is the materialist part like the these types of marxists love to look at the data like we're just data driven not Theory driven I said we there I like political economy I wouldn't identify as this type of although you know I can treat any perspective with a A Bit of Sympathy I'm being said this is sympathetic reading right so um because the textbook is doing such a non-sympathetic reading I'm going to do a sympathetic reading uh I don't have to agree with it but these are just interesting Concepts so the world's dead and this is uh Citibank this is city city group one of the major banks in the U.S in 2005 produced a report they've been doing this for a while they have ultra high net worth individuals books about this written I'll reference in a minute the world is divided into two blocks now the plutonomy where the economic growth is powered consumed by a wealthy few and then there's everybody else so there's no such thing as a u us consumer UK consumer Russian consumer anymore there are rich consumers few in number but just proportionate huge amounts of income and wealth these billionaires who can spend on whatever they can buy things um on a whim and sell them and Destroy them whatever they want right they can go to space they can go to submarines they could go wherever they want and then there's everybody else the non-rich the many accounting for small bites of national pie this is a bank saying this this isn't me okay so let's meme this  up um sorry for the swear um so stuff like this like we don't need a big analytical Theory to explain the idea of like forcing people to take unpaid leave during the pandemic so I could afford to fly myself to space is not great um the idea that someone who's got a Maserati and a yacht who represents the global one percent by a large Mark a margin is against things like child tax credit maternity leave child care and 35 insulin you could see how that could be rile people up um the fact that um that you can cancel as the uh Trump tax cuts did uh taxes for 1.7 trillion for 600 billionaires but not 1.7 trillion in student loan debt for 45 million Americans um seems to be unequal um if we did this in a basic level if somebody hoarded more and more of something well other people didn't have it we would want to find out what was wrong with it but instead we have Forbes um we have mechanisms uh corporations that are legal entities fictions that allow um businesses to create one that to Shell itself out I thought this was made up but I checked it out and no it's legit I was like am I just proper getting misinformation nope it's a little more nuanced than that they can't totally get out of their liability but they they have to some extent limited their liability again that's a limited Corporation not only that like we can expose all the time that we have all of the elites uh not paying their taxes globally um they use some type of offshore accounts to us to avoid taxes because they're sleazy whatever um nobody cares right so how is it that nobody cares about that or even if they care they can't do anything about it um and so we get instead these kind of these constant BR these PR bombardment about how important it is for us to know about the lives of these people rather than to care about things that happen so it becomes this it becomes a form of Sport the U.S is now obsessed with who's the richest person in the world and where'd they get their money well if you look at who the richest people are a lot of them got their money from uh Tech or things related to Tech in large part because they can minimize their taxes through a whole bunch of mechanisms but primarily by making sure that their income is as nil and that they own things in uh Capital values that the price of their stocks so they don't actually count as they've got this wealth but they don't have the income that that we can tax or they figure out ways to put it offshore and so here who are the richest Millennials who are the richest women and and the richest women are in these sectors right all of these different sectors many of them just of the Walton the Walton family the Walmarts um they do this so this is just a friend of mine he did this one percent the rest of us this is a political economy of dominant ownership and the 400 richest Americans have seen their effective tax rate cut by more than half since 1962. remember the marginal tax rate at the end of World War II for the top percent was 92 percent it is nowhere near that and anymore and so the bottom half during that same period who earned 18 500 a year saw their tax burden increase from 22 percent to 22.5 to 24 so this is the type of stuff that that yes it sounds like class Warfare if you've got a holistic system which is who's paying what for how much and you say the people at the top should pay less and less and the people at the bottom should pay more and more that's what we would call a regressive taxation system it's taking from the bulk to give to the few a progressive taxation system gives from the few and distributes to everybody we talked about this before in the context of Robin Hood right anyways so what this does though it's not just that it's also the transformation of the idea that everybody is invested in what happens with these billionaires right my Amazon Prime package comes quick because Jeff Bezos was able to innovate this and during the pandemic he made billions of billions of dollars well I had to sit home because I couldn't do the things that I traditionally would do and we relied on Amazon Prime so I'm not saying Amazon Prime is bad but as a system it reproduces and reinforces the wealth of these people at the top and so this idea of us now in being invested in what corporations do and what billionaires do is now like they are the leaders on politics and this thought thing these these thought issues and the black lives matter and in June you know they all had Pride flags up and so if we're actually looking at the analysis of this the history of meritocracy if we want to explain how it happens it's often because of these things it's that they make one kind of big innovation or one decision or Discovery and then they realize oh because of that if we want to maintain this and make sure we've got more we now have to in the case of Facebook have more um uh political lobbyists in Washington than there are members of the state department because they have to use that position of their early Advantage whatever they did they had one Innovation and then use that information to to create and maintain their wealth and so the idea of having strategic people from positions of power in the state military or in the corporations go back and forth in a kind of circular manner means that they're going to have more and more interest over or government policy making in society and then once they've accumulated those advantages they'll use that to make sure that they have more rest Prestige Wealth power and that we won't criticize them more and more famously New York Times a couple years ago said we can't do investigative reports anymore of the type of uh internal whistleblowing that happens within corporations or the bad things that corporations do because they can sue us out of existence we will only focus on the bad things that happen in the state um and so that that's a an interesting admission because they don't have the money they honestly don't they don't have the money to fight in court a a 1.5 trillion dollar company but they can fight a government because the government is a slow-moving thing and it has um obligations of of uh public information and providing um public access to documents and things like that so it's easier to do that so you understand and so this idea then is that what was public or should have been public has been and it continues to be maintained by um a powerful oligarchy that advances a particular interest this is that stuff we talked about before with oligarchy Stigler stiglitz he's a kind of Lefty uh Economist um calls this the US government is is one of the one percent by the one percent and for the one percent and so just some of the absurdities that come out of this for example like you know a U.S of income of 250 000 a year puts you in the 0.04 of the World Elite it's such a small number but we hear so much from those people globally um things like Forbes Magazine Saudi Prince suit Forge magazine because they under reported as well as 20 billion rather than 29.6 billion this idea that it's a a Perpetual competition like somehow hoarding resources is is a thing that we should value right this is the Marxist criticism and this is always what both male and marks argued is that possession of things is not the same as the capacity to buy things and so if you have an effective flat minimum wage since the mid 70s you're going to see the ways in which it's not just how much income you have it's if that income can help you buy things so I am in my 40s and I still rent because I didn't get into for many decisions I didn't get in the market and so now I'm stuck in the situation where I'm constantly paying my landlord's mortgage right and so that idea then of of producing things like unaffordable housing unaffordable education unaffordable Health Care um and as I've talked about before that bottom 20 the US has negative income because they're in debt and so you have this group at the top that's making more and more on the bottom is actually negative um and this isn't party based on my Facebook profile picture is um the clintons and the trumps hand-in-hand at one of the the events they were at right back that it doesn't mean anything it's just the argument here is that you know the idea that they fight each other in terms of politics but then get together socially is is a kind of class analysis right that's what it is so um so in terms of this then um part of the big problems that we have today came from the Clinton Administration um allowing the loophole of letting companies put their headquarters in Ireland famously Apple does this um so that all of your transactions take place offshore which means that you have effectively chose as a state and passing these laws Democratic decisions to pass laws to allow huge amounts of money to go outside the system so those companies don't have to pay taxes um so American earning statements they look like money losers they pay zero taxes and profit shift and costs oh well more than 60 billion the um what is it it's not oecd it's not Greenpeace it's the other one anyways there's so much stuff on tax avoidance wealth avoidance and there's the tax Justice UK does nothing but this they have great data on this on this is just hundreds of billions of dollars every year because of a decision made in the U.S about how taxes are reported and so the idea here is that this the livability of people for that top group is is increased in in proportion massively and everybody else is kind of stuck where they were um not only that the idea of of what is valued and how we value it then if there's more and more money out there remember and it's like the stock market's 85 institutional investors and 85 percent of it's totally automated they maintain the stock exchange in order to prevent like provide the theater that there's a market there but in fact it's dominated by a very small group of of um investment funds mutual funds and institutional investors but one of the weird Parts about this then is that like these firms that don't pay taxes have valuations that are in really really high because everyone can see hey they don't have to pay taxes they're going to do pretty well or we say we're going to put all our money into them because that's where the future goes and we want to invest in the future of technology so you hit these weird inversions that say like things like the stock market and how much people are worth don't actually reflect reality per se now this is a classic Marxist argument I don't agree with it at all it does reflect reality but whatever um so we have this in in 2021 where Tesla is worth more than all of the other car makers combined um that Tesla produces uh you know eight uh billion in Revenue but is worth a trillion and Ford and GM um are worth way more but their stock their valuations way less like the number of vehicles that Tesla produces versus all the rest is it's significant this is actually improved a bit Tessa's got more and everybody's betting on electric so that's what the bet is here they're all betting on electric but in terms of like how things work or who's employed where all the rest of those companies are producing the bulk of the cars and they have the bulk of the workers but they're worth next to nothing or or not combined they're worth as much as one Tesla right and you can see that too in terms of firms that even in terms of their assets like Exxon is worth more in terms of its total assets than Apple or um or these other ones but their their stock price makes them more valuable and this is because we have these systems and structures made up so what all this means is that the more that we reinforce these structures of power the more the inequality increases and so this would be a Marxist analysis that we didn't get anything like in the textbook just the idea that um State capture happens so if you look at any of these um like Alec is really fascinating Alec is like a not-for-profit that exists who allow um a set of policies to be adopted in every state at every level because they write them all and then give them to all the different groups that want them normally Republicans give them all it's a republican organization it's not it's not-for-profit that works for politicians who are Republican so they don't have to write their own legislation these are funded by these big not-for-profit organizations that then write the legislation that Republicans pass that over reading right um this happens on the left as well this is what FTX was doing with SBF before he went under was funneling his crypto money into this producing left versions of this as well like they are going to be the ones that Foster um kind of innovative policies the all of these lab and there's a long history of this of of key billionaires supporting ideas and values that they um like and see and so we see this over and over again um this it's reinforcing this plutocratic bias endowments to universities um making sure that they help specific ideological organizations that reinforce their point of view rather than just giving money the poor right which is what tax if they pay more taxes which would happen right because it would be in the public offers um and so they're not really interested in fixing big problems like things in the public interest but promoted promoting Technical and technocratic fixes which they largely benefit from so tech chat GPT or llms or AI is going to change the world but we're not sure it's going to change the world for the better and it's those people at the ground floor that are going to be making the monies and so this is just a basic Marxist analysis as an example because there wasn't any examples in the text of why it could still be relevant and how it's really easy to make these arguments you don't need to use big words because you can do it in meme form
 okay so um yeah approaches these theories some people call them myths um uh I when I'm teaching the second year international relations course I call them myths because that's what Cynthia Weber calls them um some people call them stories some people call them theories they're just a series of debates between people who say they have a better framework for explaining what's happening at the international level um these debates revolve around three separate kind of let's say schools um realism is one so realism I mean this isn't actually telling a good story realism emerges as a critique of idealism as this perceived notion that using these ideal approaches that we use at the domestic level when we talk about Theory don't function internationally so it's a criticism of ideas liberalism says that actually the evidence of international the International System is largely moving towards more cooperation therefore we can see cooperation in institutions as the main thing that explains the world and this Marxist approach which isn't explained well but I'll kind of bring in some examples is to see the system as a coherent whole in which way in which case like if someone's uh benefiting it's normally at the expense of someone else or the idea that conflict is inherent to the system it's not outside the system liberalism doesn't have an endogenous theory of violence it doesn't believe that that violence comes from Liberal Frameworks realism believes that the whole system is always headed towards violence violence is the natural outcome of this system um and we'll talk about why that's the case and then these three Challengers is what we'll get into okay so this is this is from Weber she says that these are these starting assumptions of realism which are much more complex than this because it's the dominant approach in the U.S so there are thousands of people doing this type of work all the way back to Henry Kissinger which we can have questions about what happens when you adopt this stuff in actual policy terms part of the Hitchens case against Henry Kissinger calling him a war criminal was that he adopted these approaches in his application of policy and to this day and still insists um that that he was right in doing it um he can't travel certain countries in the world for fear of prosecution but that's a separate Point okay so the international Anarchy myth um is basically just this back to our 1648 discussion International politics is composed of Sovereign Nation States there is no world government which means there was no International orderer um there isn't so um at best the United Nations even when we're talking about something like the universal Declaration of Human Rights we can declare that human rights it is um largely aspirational as a document it does not require anything specific of states it just insists that states should follow the principles of it and they are it's up to individual states to implement those things so statehood is embedded in the U.N which means it is not a world government because there's no higher authority everything that happens at the U.N is with the consent of decisions made by States um and so the absence of this world order uh world orderer or World Government means that International politics is by definition anarchical and not this doesn't mean disorder back to our discussion Anarchy right it doesn't mean chaos it just means there's no higher authority to tell any individual State what to do right that's how um it functions it's just the absence of a higher authority and so this is in in its basic form statism we're going to talk about what the International System is we have to talk about nation states they are the thing those 193 of them that's what it is and we're not creating more at a rate of speed that would make them significant and everybody wants to have them and they fight over the control of them right that's what we do and so um the three aspects of realism this is a good way that the 3s is to remember them statism survival and self-help so the state is the preeminent actor in terms of this kind of realist approach to international relations the struggle for power between different states is the goal of the system right um you know where States want to achieve their political will and so they can do it with Force but they can also do it with an election interference right you can make sure that people who get elected are sympathetic to your cause or you've donated to them so that they um they are beholden to you right um these type of things and so you can understand the problem like at nation state wants to say don't interfere in my Affairs but you have to stop them from doing a sovereign state has to exercise its sovereignty and if it doesn't then the rest of the system can kind of there's nobody telling them they can they agreed to when they signed the U.N that you're not supposed to interfere in the Affairs of other states but that's generally just an agreement and I mean you're not supposed to declare war because that might actually upset the other states but as far as election interference goes it's kind of up to the state to stop it from happening right um because you're all Sovereign like you want to interfere in somebody else's election they've got to stop you it's this problem there's nobody telling you not to do it right they're telling you you shouldn't do it and you agreed to not do it but you agreeing to something isn't the same as a government telling you if you do it this will happen right okay and so um all of these national interests come in different forms they can come in terms of trying to achieve the most wealth resources capabilities or military power nation states are perceived of as pursuing rationality so this is another theory of the system um we can say that there are irrational actors but even irrational actors are perceived of through their actions as acting rationally so even if we don't agree with the North Korean system at all and we know they've got nuclear weapons they have not and will not fire one of those nuclear weapons at the U.S this is the underlying Assumption of this system right that that they recognize no matter how different they are they recognize that their actions will be perceived by others and they will be responsible for the actions that happen and so there is rationality in the system even for actors that are perceived of as irrational now remember this is just for nation states and so as a consequence of this then there is no Central Authority and so states are always going to try to maximize in this framework in this myth they're always going to try to maximize their personal benefit and so um there's a bunch of different uh controversies that we can't get into and actually they're not that interesting about why this stuff happens famously Walt says you know the cause of war is found in the nature and behavior of man okay let's let's run with that it's it's gendered but in a way that okay War results from selfishness miscorrect misdirected aggressive impulses from stupidity if these are the causes of War then the elimination of war must come through uplifting and enlightening men are securing their social um psycho psychic social Readjustment okay yes uh yeah there's problems in masculinity and that that's uh indicating it but it's there's also problems here with the idea that states reflect individual selfishness and that individual selfishness because we can treat States as unitary actors are also selfish um this is largely a behaviorist tradition so we are extrapolating State action from the behavior of people it has been since the 70s largely fallen out of favor for the idea it's just the structural Anarchy um even Canada is going to try to maximize it and it may believe all the values of the world in the world but it's still going to try to maximize its interest when it goes into a trade negotiation with the US so it doesn't matter what your values and our ideals are you are going to pursue your self-interest and so you do this because you want to survive because there is uh survival is not guaranteed under a system of Anarchy no one and this is the the survival and self-help is no one's going to help you because everybody's literally their own thing um and so it's a zero sum and this isn't 100 true but this is a zero-sum framework where if you get um benefit if you get more if you have more power capability resources it comes at the expense of another um so this can be in absolute or relative terms right so just because you have acquired a nuclear weapon that may put you ahead of all the other states that don't have one but if you only have one and the US has 50 it's still going to be a relative thing and so this idea is that there is a competition to survive and this is always going to stem from selfishness now I apologize for the whiteness of this video hopefully it doesn't get copyright blocked but this is a classic stupid argument I asked chechi PT for all of the examples in this video that is an appropriate use of chat GPT brainstorming ideas perfectly fine seven of the eight ideas on any of these videos were bad so just because you're brainstorming and just because you've got somebody else doesn't mean they're good ideas anyways this is a video talking about the idea of selfishness sorry thieves I just you know I just wanted to do a good deed like like you did with the babies this isn't a good deed you what about you having those babies for your brother talk about selfish thing about well yeah it was a really nice thing and all but it made you feel really good right yeah so well it made you feel good so that makes it selfish look there's no unselfish Good Deed sorry considered selfless well may I ask for one example yeah it's you know there's no you may not that's because all people are selfish are you calling me selfish are you calling you people yeah sorry to burst that bubble thieves but selfless Good Deeds don't exist okay and you know the deal on Santa Claus right find a selfless Good Deed I'm gonna beat you you Evil Genius okay I don't think I need to go through the whole video but the underlying premise here is just that um there is an argument that there is no such thing as a selfless act that everything is selfish it's an argument it's not a particularly good one because you know we reproduce and socially care for one another and we do so even for animals and things that we don't necessarily have an immediate interest if the idea of benefit is selfish then we then I don't know what what love is because then love would just be perceived of as selfish which it totally could be um but this reductive it's very reductive so the oversimplification excessively oversimplifies right it makes everything into one framework regardless of what happens and so this idea of of self-interest or self-help um is a a oversimplified understanding of the Anarchy of each state relying on its own power and so the absence of a global Sovereign creates the 911 problem this idea that nobody intervened in Afghanistan early enough to stop 911. maybe um you know 911 was non-state actors as well so this Theory actually doesn't have a whole lot to say and then we'll get to this in the constructivist stuff part of the constructivist critique of this framework is that it if states are everything then you can't really explain terrorism and you can't really explain anything that's not a state right and it's a long history of humans haven't been in States so it doesn't make a ton of sense um but these security dilemmas are increased as each state seeks to increase its power so one of the perceptions was is that Libya was too belligerent and therefore NATO had to intervene right they were acting in their own self-interest but their self-interest threatened the self-interest of others and when they bind together they intervene to do that and so this is the idea of keeping a balance of power States band together to keep others in check because they are self-interested in Collective or aggrandizing power into institutions or ways of doing things and so NATO is one of the example but during the the Cold War we also had the Warsaw Pact right that the Soviets saw this as well and said listen we have to have a Soviet Union to counter this perceived ways in which the the West Was mobilizing themselves so the question and there is no answer to this question and we go through this debate every 10 years in international relations about which system is best so is it best to have a system where there's a single strong actor this is really the end of World War II when the U.S is willing to subsidize the creation of the UN to rebuild all of the the economies after the war and guarantee the International System so we see that as a largely unipolar system but almost immediately the Soviet Union rising up creates a bipolar system and the Cold War then between the Soviet unions and the west or the Americans was seen as relatively stable in terms of expressions of global conflict right um that there were wasn't a lot of incentives for states to try to challenge the supremacy of those two and in fact a lot of developing nations took advantage of this and played both sides right so I'll do something for you you give me something I'll do something for you you give me something um but it reinforces state power which is to say that a lot of those people playing both sides were dictators or terrible regimes or would do stuff and we didn't intervene because they were an ally and so this idea of a bipolar system has some benefits for stability has a lot of um problems as well but the multi-polar system is generally agreed to be it might be the most democratic like when we talk about democracy but it's also the most unstable because when you're constantly trying to one-up one another each other and gain power and relative power and influence you can do things and and utilize the system against itself so for example without a single hegemonic actor it certainly makes sense for Russia to counter what it sees as you know NATO by intervening in Ukraine and saying that we are just in waging this war and the West says no you're not just in waging this war but we don't have anybody to adjudicate that dispute because they're both sitting members of the United Nations and they can veto one another that we'll talk about in a minute there isn't any framework to deal with this so we end up with a multi-polar system that doesn't seem like it can respond to these these these problems it's not like the past that said the bipolar system produced multiple interventions on both sides in Afghanistan that led to the situation that led to 9 11 that led to the reintervention then led to them leaving again so if if you've the history of Afghanistan is not one of stability based on the bipolar system and so realism then is just this idea that the system of Anarchy is going to produce self-help and this this sovereignty and self-help Notions are the ways in which we can these three sovereignty selfishness and self-help right survival and self-help are the ways in which we can frame the realist intervention
 so we'll just finish off with the textbook video I couldn't find the exact one but this is the same arguments being made so it'll be similar to what was there say they were stunned the scope of the U.S announcement to withdraw almost 12 000 troops from Germany including moving fighter jets from the spangdalum Air Force Base to Italy and the U.S European command from Stuttgart to Belgium it is the biggest shakeup of U.S forces in Europe since World War II defense secretary Mark esper said this at the Pentagon these changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing U.S and NATO deterrence of Russia strengthening NATO reassuring allies and improving U.S strategic flexibility and ucom operational flexibility but at the White House president Donald Trump made clear that he also has other reasons for the sweeping changes why would we keep all of those troops there and now Germany's saying it's bad for their economy well it's good for our economy Germany so bad for their economy good for our economy the other video just talked about the idea that it's this this notion that Germany wasn't paying enough into NATO I mean very few of the NATO allies so this is a good example here right military security we're banding together we're cooperating together in NATO everybody cooperates lets us do things like um go in and get Gaddafi uh Canada amongst many others aren't doing as part of the NATO agreement you're supposed to spend two percent of GDP on the military we we don't we simply don't most of them don't uh Germany actually kind of is closer than most um but you know Trump is was saying here that if you're not cooperating so this is a liberal part if you're not engaging in literal cooperation we're going to put punishments in to try to make you cooperate they're not like coercive punishments are not causing harm per se but they're trying to say that that cooperation isn't coming um so therefore we're not going to do it this is from Voice of America which is the U.S military kind of um news station so it's funny that we can barely hear what his criticism Trump has had harsh criticism for Germany for years appearing to view it as an economic threat instead of a close partner and observers have noted his cool interactions with Chancellor Angela Merkel some transatlantic experts say the announcement deals a body blow to the critical U.S German relationship weakens NATO and delights Russian President Vladimir Putin but any removal of U.S headquarters in Germany which had been there for decades which are cement in our relationship not only with Europe but with Germany it's just fundamentally undermines U.S security interests I think Watchers are clearly surprised at the speed at which the administration is potentially moving forward other experts say the move is likely to hurt America's own strategic interest more than it hurts Germany or Europe so this is the tough one right so the U.S can do whatever it wants it's got the power to do what it wants it can act and self-interest like the realist says but the Cooperative Arrangements security Arrangements of NATO were beneficial and actually helped its interest and now this could be said to be one of the reasons that Putin thought it was easier to go into Ukraine it's because you've done this we've moved from a unipolar system to a multi-polar system where we're not sure again is still a very important Hub or you know declarations in North Africa in the Middle East oh my God the audience and if you reduce Personnel from these hubs basically you're responsive the less strategic value by not having them there the audio is not great and so this idea of of the the things that happen globally in those kind of interactions the the nation-state model the um the liberal model this Marxist model of inequality the feminist model the constructivist model they all explain the events in different ways and have different things to say and so this is the kind of tougher part about dealing with the international is that we have to decide which story we think is most compelling given the events that have taken place we don't know that the approach is the best one to do that famously we have there's a case study a classic case study in in international relations at the Cuban Missile Crisis that adopts all three different approaches it adopts three different approaches with three different Frameworks and they all explain the events and so they they're mutually exclusive they don't need to explain what the other one's doing but they can also explain the outcome and so theories International theories international relations tries to capture some of global politics but it's not going to capture all of it because it's going to be necessarily incomplete this is an open system a complex system where they interact with one another and all these different approaches a plain explain different aspects
 okay [Music] um dealing with the idea of political normativity then means that we have to come to terms of what are we saying we should do right we have these Alternatives but we need to think about what we mean by these things social justice okay social under human Justice ecological Justice attuned to relationships and domination support and subordination ecocentric egalitarian values the goal is not merely to understand the world but to change it aren't we doing that in the climate change aren't we changing it too radically um I don't know that this is disruptive as critique political ecology seeks to expose the flaws in the dominant approaches the environment favored by corporate State and international authorities working to demonstrate the point of view of local people margin group vulnerable it works to denaturalize certain social and environmental conditions showing them to be the contingent outcomes of power not inevitable I think that's what we would do in the whole course right try to figure out how contestation happens I it can be post positivist I don't know what needs to be we've got lots of positivist evidence that these are problems that we need to address so it introduces this idea of critical realism but doesn't really explain what it is it's just the idea of this notion that that there's a world um independent of our thoughts and perceptions organized in different ways and this goes back to remember the I don't know if everybody watching The Tick Tock video but the dog perception or that filter you can put on Tick Tock to see the way that dogs see the world we are limited by our the meat sacks of our brain is in our eyes and the cones and the vision that we see there are clearly stuck beyond our visible realm and sounds beyond our audible realm things that happen in the world that we can't understand based on our current ways of seeing but that we can scientifically show that exist but without that science we don't know they exist and so this idea of recognizing the limits of our knowledge is also about our ability to perceive these things and then recognize that perception as politically useful so we want to explain how these problems happen and work for change but we need to be able to to do so and so perception then is also about like I don't know what any of this means but it's interesting to think about it so this is a new close-up clip of a plant breathing so this was captured over there in San Diego at the University of California and it's absolutely amazing so just to kind of explain what's going on here so plants they're the exact opposite of us right so we breathe in oxygen and then exhale carbon dioxide and then plants use their little mouths which are these called stomata to take in that carbon dioxide and release oxygen it's such an amazing balance we give them what they need to survive and they in turn give us what we need to survive so this to us does that matter does it make significant to us that we can see plants breathing does it matter to us that that grass when you cut it releases a sound or impact to that around it that you could call screaming I don't know if you would want to do that because then it makes it harder to eat things right things we identify with become harder harder to kill and so I've got it here this is what um this is what Peta has argued because I mean we Are overfishing we almost overfished all of our our fish stocks so maybe we wouldn't overfish so much if we called them sea kittens because then we perceive them through the realm of human Memorial kind of reciprocity right like mammals they do this all the time and mammals take care of other mammals offspring sometimes they eat them sometimes take care of them there's no predicting per se what what's going to happen weird situations produce weird outcomes but this idea that if we put some anthropocentric mammalianism into fish maybe we would be less likely to kill them on mass and so this is this this idea that thinking about critical realism the textbook doesn't do this but this is an interesting world that the idea of pollution for example is largely framed in terms of human experience and the impact it has on the life that we see as valuable more normally because we either value it because we we like it or because it feeds us we don't see it necessarily as intrinsically valuable because there are certain things that we we see our pests or weeds or problems invasive right that are upsetting what we see as a natural order natural Being Framed as equilibrium rather than this equilibrium it's not clear that that's the case and so we're limited by the cognition that we see what we see how we experience it we use the word like that the mug is blue rather than the mug Blues because it's actually just the light that's bouncing off it and the cones in our eyes that can perceive it whereas dogs see it or don't in different ways so for them it may not be right and so this idea of of human fallibility um is also part of of human reason because what we reason is what we can can prove and so we have these Transformations and and uh science all the time when we discover oh crap the way we've been doing stuff has is wrong and we have to rethink all the ways we've been doing it but we were doing that based on scientific method on what we have at the time and so the Assumption of that teleological progress is that we are moving towards a better outcome but in terms of global climate change I don't have evidence of that and so jevin's Paradox is is that example right this idea of the idea that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase and not decrease fuel use so if that's the case then it's not clear that we are moving in that direction and then there is the question that's come up of late of whether or not the rest of the world wants us or that it it's happy with what we're doing and so this has been going on and I don't know how to interpret it we could just interpret it as one's experience who is now mobilizing others against us but it's this is a map showing 59 orca attacks off the coast of Portugal but it doesn't even include the recent attacks in 2022 and 2023 they've gotten a lot of media attention for two reasons one they actually managed to sink some boats and two it looks a lot like one orca is teaching the others different techniques for disabling boats and that's what I want to focus on is orca intelligence because their brains are remarkable they have the highest degree of gyrification or the wrinkliness of their cortex of any animal as well as an incredibly well developed insular cortex which is responsible for casual things like Consciousness empathy compassion and self-awareness the language abilities that orcas display as pack hunters and social creatures all of their lives are incredible so science has given us this information which is great but at the turn of the century Industrial Revolution every light post in London was lit with whale oil so okay we don't do that as much anymore so I guess that's good these are some of the sounds that Wiki and orca and Marineland France learn to mimic from humans hello Amy [Music] even more impressive to me is the fact that one orca that was socialized with dolphins essentially learned to speak dolphin in that the frequency and Cadence of its chirps changed range to be within the minimum to maximum dolphin range rather than the normal Orca range scientists also know that each Community has its own unique sounds so these three PODS of orcas near me in the Sailor sea make up one community and they have sounds they can use when they all come together but each pod has its own Unique Sounds relative to their hunting tactics and sounds they only use to signify one member of the group which to me that means names and the other orcas do not understand those sounds nor use them they're learned sounds this study quantifies their remarkable ability to teach and learn from one another which I will show the experimental and observational evidence for it so I don't know how you interpret this data um it's just data you can reject it out of hand and say no humans are still more important than orcas you can put it as equivalent they are at least on some more level should be given some type of personhood and then you could go further and say looks like they're kind of mad and that trauma of that one orca who's teaching the others is kind of like that orcas put up with it but are you willing to go that far and understand that as a form of political conflict I don't I don't have any evidence that you're going to do that we can talk about this in class but I don't have a ton of evidence that you're willing to make that leap to recognize that maybe parts of the environment are mad at us and are trying to get us back for what we've done but we don't like to think in those ways and so this chapter says critical realism as if it's just like oh well you know it's just these precepts but if you push it far enough it gets pretty radical we just don't see any of that in the chapter
 so I'm not trying to be nillest or anything here um I will say that um we only know this stuff because we learn more all the time we have to be introduced by already to understand some of the significance of what's happening what we're doing we can't just have it as a singular field and there's too much of these policy outcomes or that that United Nations video that just assumes that somehow like the UN alone could pass a a law but again it would be up to states to implement them so it's not clear that the UN even has the capacity to make these changes that we would want and that we would need all those other analyzes to understand things like the Amazon decolonization so there is a a this is I think it's from the dark Mountain Manifesto just a weird kind of Manifesto dealing with this stuff is that a lot of how we think about progress or about human kind of history and development is about this idea of a relationship to nature which is one where we are destined for greatness and the greatness is cost free we are part of the world but better than it we're distinct in that we have separated ourselves in the Triumph of how we think we we have overtaken nature in one this is our our Glory this is how we think about ourselves we we don't we don't recognize the way in which that fundamentally distorts our relationship to the world right we don't think of the earth as sacred we we don't put ourselves as another mammal alongside the rest um we think ourselves as exterior to it um and so this idea of climate change as a lived experience is that we are destructive force of nature we have changed the course of nature but if we're nature then I don't know what that means and that climate volatility and uncertainty is now the norm and so what is natural is like there's nothing there's everything natural about a media hitting a planet but at the same time there's nothing natural about it right the word nature doesn't mean a whole lot there's a whole lot that emerges from this idea of of what it is to be nature we've con traditionally thought about this idea of like nature is a limitless store of resources for us we have the capacity to do it it's malleable the most effective uh means of raising liver standards is economic growth which it has been but it has an environmental cost right ever expanding material abundance we create things under our control as if we choose the outcomes that we need a work ethic that we have to be diligent and then there's a freedom and material abundance we think it is free and so we're not clear that this has particularly product produced the best outcomes when we look at it in an ecological perspective we're not actually taking things and looking at like the 70 billion chickens we kill every year we don't think of those as we think of them as food right which is fine it's just I'm not sure that that's the most ecologically sound way to do it and so a lot of social justice arguments about these things ecological Justice arguments are framed in humans terms so we want to keep something because it is valuable to us literally for our survival and so the UN then is is primarily an that should be an anthropo-centric organization and then there's something like we need to pers protect non-human politics I think this is Naomi Klein from 2000 uh fine uh 2004. um our economic system and our planetary system are at War our economy is at war with life on Earth including human life the climate needs to avoid collapse as a contraction of the use of resources our economic model um demands you know unfettered expansion to grow and one of the sets of rules can change and it's not going to be the laws of nature and so we have this fundamental tension in how we think about the relationship of of humans to the world and and how we can accomplish uh these ends and so thinking about this then it's not at all clear that Marxism State socialism social democracy liberalism how about a whole lot to say about this they've largely left these questions alone and listen the the Soviet system was a particular level of horror when it comes to the environment because of the lack of feedback mechanisms of a centrally controlled command economy at least in open systems you can complain when you are being systemically poisoned you just hope as we'll talk about a bit later when we're dealing with Pacific island nuclear colonialism you just hope that people hear and care and so this is also about this idea of the majority deciding again and the ways in which we can do this and so we have this long history of of the ways in which human expansion has also been about the transformation of the world um you know the British brought back all the species from their colonial encounters and spread biome and bacteria around the world famously when the the British got to the Himalayas they came in contact with the bacteria that got on them and then got on their ships and rotted all the wood in the British Empire so they had to shift to metal based hulls because of bacteria and so a lot of the reasons that we pick the plants that we have and the ones that propagate are because we decide what matters we decide which ones are pretty and the messed up part is that plants then in their systems and symbiotics the ones that fry Thrive are going to be the ones that are attractive to us and so we still eat and part of the reason we have so much food waste is because we eat with our eyes and we don't like to eat misshapen food and so we throw out all of it I talked about the carrots example before and so so much of how even our our food systems are generated are based on anthropocentric views of how we should decide on which things should be grown which things shouldn't be grown what are sustainable what are good remember chicken wings back in the day right Americans didn't eat that part of the chicken it was totally wasteful and then in Buffalo somebody didn't have anything but the wings left over threw them in a deep fryer and now we kill on mess there's a a glut of chicken breasts after the Super Bowl because we eat so many Just Wings right so we change the the the world around us because of this and so the politicization of nature is always bound up in The Human Experience this for example was one that I described as these ideas about how what is an invasive species is about what types of vegetal experiences we value and don't and how we politicize nature as valuable to communities not humanity and so we've got this over and over again and based of plants to to watch for invasiveness is not a scientific category it's a deeply political one we don't like to think I from an indigenous perspective I have a tough time not thinking that settler colonialism doesn't look like an invasive I guess we're since there were the same species it's it's a different type of invasion but we immediately do this this is a book there that Peter Coates has that talks about like the the instant that the the Colonials um social contract settlers settle they immediately start turning on things that they see as natural and unnatural um we we bring stuff with us right all of those things that I showed in that Padma video before that nothing in the apple pie is indigenous North America it comes with this this settler movement the colonial movements of of things and in 1883 there was a campaign the immigrants brought over sparrows with them to North America and then they turned on those sparrows as being um if poverty filthful and tenements that real American birds were losing to these sparrows that came in as an invasive species and so what codes is talking about is like how do we decide what is good and bad and ugly clean and dirty health and health healthy they largely come back to our majority sensibilities about the way we should use things you know chicken feet used to be seen as food waste there is no such thing as food waste you can figure out ways to do it awful right like brains gallbladders gizzards those type of things lots of different communities have figured out ways to consume them but different communities decide what what is food waste what is edible and what isn't right we decide that we don't eat pets because we see that as different but yet we we kill cows we race horses babies horse racing is babies we we raise babies and we make money off babies this year has been particularly bad for horse racing thousands of them were dying in the last several years horse racing because we say that we want to bet on horses baby stock let's be clear because they're under two they're babies my wife's a horse riding instructor she doesn't they don't even in her sport they don't even get on them until three or four because they're not they're too little and in horse racing we just do it so how we decide what is troublesome how we decide what is it belongs and what doesn't what is a stranger is totally based on in-group and out group species um this idea even that in New England Federalist Papers had all these racist fears that the Irish and the French were alien to what did North American or the American Experience was American is apple pie is a saying and yet nothing from it is indigenous to North America and there's a long history of the ways in which biopiracy which the colonial experience grabs things and throws them somewhere else I don't have time for it I wrote a paper about this but um Henry Ford famously wanted to create Ford landia this this this image of a perfect uh town in Brazil where he could grow all of the um the rubber for the the Ford cars um but he brought in these and tried to create these fields it didn't work at all the soil wasn't good and there was bacteria and it didn't work at all but when they did do it in Indonesia it there was no natural Predators it and that's where we still get rubber from to this day so the ways in which crops flourish and have predators and not Predators is very much bound up in human systems so humans absolutely are embedded in non-human systems but we think of them as subject to our whims how we think about them and so this is a human Central Prejudice that we don't actually think about the ways in which we are co-evolved with other species like everything on the planet is at the same level of evolution of as us but we think that we are somehow Superior and this is what leads to things like global warming or the idea that it's okay to do that there are alternatives this is a book in particular Susan Hale talks about the the history of this she goes through all the traditions of this the ways in which indigenous knowledge is like many places around the world have different experiences to Nature have more sustainable experience of Nature and that they belong to and rather not above that nature so this is in the genre actual the actual translation of the names of Mohawk Oneida anodega Cayuga and Seneca people of the Flint people of the sanding Stone people at the hills people the marsh area people of the Great Hills so it's your identity is bound up with where you are and what you do there is not this this clear there's a relationship it's not a separation or and so we have all of these these Frameworks even the the creation stories Great Law of Peace and the the good message of handsome lake is all about the relationship and you see these in the stories all the time of of non-human persons having a significant role on on the impact of human persons they're just different persons right um and so we've got this it's it's embedded in the structures and the ways of thinking about the Confederacy the tree of peace and so here's just the tree of Peace again that I've mentioned at the beginning but this is more about the the its impact which we should do we should think in a multi-disciplinary way the idea of a peace treaty also being about ecology we just don't do that [Music] stock volume anyway [Music] foreign [Music] so this idea of the lawfulness of practice is not some type of human universalism it's got the life of the planet at the center right it's got the tree at the center and so this idea of of these these changing relationships but this is a choice right this is a conscious Choice it's a they weren't always this way this wasn't always this way that's the whole point is that you have to make the choice in order to produce the peace and have this at its Center and we're just not sure the tree of peace is at the center and so we don't really think about that we also don't think about the ways in which agriculture is about settlement practices right there's a whole bunch of debates I'm not going to get into them but food science debates food history anthropology debates about why humans settled or or continue to migrate in the ways they do one of the theories is beer right people in order to have beer they had to settle and farm and in order to farm that created the settlements and that's how we did things interestingly enough the HUD and Ashanti when after the Great Law of Peace and and the encounter with um settlers they shifted their survival strategies because you couldn't right like the the grossness of reserves but the idea of traditional hunting trapping and the ability to move and and live off the land shifted into farming as a survival strategy and it it grew out of this ancient practice this is an ecologically sound practice of the three sisters corn beans and squash go together because they help the nitrogen helps each other they naturally resist pests and they also provide a livelihood and these are you know family plots forestry practices abridging strategy from pre-contact to post contact is reflected in the ways in which settlement happens and so we don't like to think about the idea of of the ecological as bound up in how we do things and the the changing nature that has and so we just have all of these ways in which we think about invasive species as wrecking the way I do things that weed weed right is not a scientific thing weed on my lawn must go I must put pesticide and fertilizer in order to make my grass uniform as if that makes sense especially in the U.S the ecological disaster that is just watering and herbicide and farming and maintenance of Lawns that made sense in the British experience where you have a lot of rain and you want to protect erosion but in places like Arizona or New Mexico or Nevada where you have golf courses you have this this sense of political ecology that's totally backwards right and so this idea of thinking about the ways in which you produce this and political ecology can look to these Alternatives but we have to be open to doing that and it's not clear without a perspective that decenters the human from the the the core of it that we're gonna start to get anywhere with this stuff and I'm not sure I mean we didn't have any of these examples in the textbook so if we're going to talk about this idea changing the way we do things there are examples out there but we've got to look for them
 so we'll deal with this idea of political ecology disrupting political science maybe um I do think this is an issue the idea of State sovereignty as a monarch who has a singular hierarchical authority over a given territory which means that that territory is is at their disposal it was traditionally from this notion this Western notion of a monarch having Divine rule right back to the Sovereign will to Hobbes um so this framework at least wants to you know equalize it it wants to make the idea of the social and natural world as mutually constituted rooted in and shaping each other so this is similar to talk to about the tour a bit in the course but this idea that humans not outside of nature but within nature and so then we have to bring this in because when we have thought in the past about things like social Revolution public policy trade relations democracy citizenship human rights and development we don't think about the ecological World very much so when we we develop things and I'm just using this example the NAFTA agreement that was just renegotiated Canada has been trying to adopt this feminist foreign policy and so one of the things we want to do when we're dealing with trade agreements is that we want to bring in things like environment indigenous issues and gender um so NAFTA has always had a little bit to deal with the environment um but it's it's largely been on a voluntary basis or a small kind of peripheral off to the side basis and the other problem is is that in a trade agreement because of sovereignty if and this is this happened in the trading route if we want to bring up indigenous issues with the U.S in a bilateral Trade Agreement they just simply say no and you can't force another state to do anything and so that's a consequence of that so this is Stephen Gill that has been referenced a couple times the textbook but he has a framework for this it's just called this kind of disciplinary system that we have trade agreements then lock in things that are beneficial for trade and lock out things or put down your Adam harms has argue this in our department that they lock in things like uh you can't uh allow us to you know nationalize a business or you uh can't do anything that harms trade um and so as a consequence that that's locked in but things like environmental issues that are those are left the domestic level and so we have a whole system of what is called this kind of mutual legal agreements that establish everybody has to trade continue trade and allow trade to happen um and but we don't have anything similar for the environment it's all voluntary so he's just talking about new constitutionalism is the legal and juridical counterpart it it it develops constitutional legal and Nursery mechanisms to lock in that power through legislation Etc and agreements such as ttip trading investment agreements and in so doing it seeks to lock out Democratic forces in the making of fundamental policies to govern our economies and societies in what way does ttip also reflect a crisis of democracy well it it is negotiated in secret it has proposed adjudication mechanisms which are basically privatized adjudication method mechanisms it empowers uh corporations it gives corporations certain rights and freedoms so it's a very peculiar version of the rule of law insofar as the institutions of representative democracy and popular participation are not in any significant way involved in the making of This policy the adjudication of this policy is not in open courts through traditional mechanisms of adjudication by judges so it's almost a kind of self-regulation on behalf of capital governed by constitutional protections that lock out forms of democratic participation that we've been traditionally used what so when we're talking about these policies then we're not talking about policies that we have a say over in part because political science in particular has said if we want to pass these trade agreements and continue the embedded liberal framework that ensures that free trade free markets and the free flow of capital is the set the foundation of economic growth development and investment we need to do so when there's increasing opposition to those type of systems so what do we do we increasingly go more and more secretive develop these things in secret as effective policy making tools but those effective policy making tools are not being used in other Realms such as environment gender indigenous issues so this is just a bit this isn't great example I couldn't find any on on we believe that it's really important to have a chapter environment and NAFTA because the environment and the economy go together it goes together in positive ways that we believe that trade is important and that as we move to a cleaner future that Canada can work with Mexico the United States to really attract investment in the NAFTA region because we have high standards but of course Canadians expect us to protect our right to regulate we don't want to see a Flint Michigan situation we have 40 million people who rely on the Great Lakes for clean drinking water also the economic benefits the Great Lakes has been billions of dollars and so we're going to be smart about this we also understand that climate change is real and we signed on to the Paris agreement that was supported by the provinces and territories and we want to see that reflected as well so the problem with that is the way that it's framed is that it's framed in terms of national interest and National sovereignty so if you are saying that Canada has the right to set these terms for itself its own National regulation you're also saying the Americans have the right to set those terms for themselves and they can be we don't want regulation we want to defund the EPA we want to move in the opposite direction so this idea of scale which scale things happen at is important so if we're doing all our environmental activism at the uh the global scale at the UN and the local scale in our individual actions but we're not doing anything in these international trade agreements at the international level just below the global and above the national we've got a whole realm that's very effective in organizing political activity but not about environmental issues so scale really does matter here and so the idea of doing this across scales means that it should be at least we should making be making similar efforts at every scale and level and so you've got all of this they use the example of the deforestation in the the Amazon you've got local actors loggers indigenous people fighting this idea of the expropriation of their territory extractivism you've got Regional National governments so those governments can be expanding this so internationally we can be putting pressure on um Brazil not to cut down the rainforest but domestically they can be encouraging it we have ngos international non-governmental organizations coming in trying to buy up some of the rainforest to stop it from being exploited but then we have the multinational companies going in and saying here I can develop this for you we will get you to Market if you've got this stuff we will get it out for you and so there's consumerism in there so the idea here is that scale matters a lot and when we're talking about things at the at this level um we probably need a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts that we're having on the earth not just in our specific areas but as a whole and so that's the idea of the anthropocene it's on this kind of broad huge long geological scale have you heard about the anthropocene for the last 200 years humankind has caused such a Negative imprint on the environment that some scientists describe it as a new geological age the age of human impact on Earth or the anthropocene it's the pre-industrial era and especially since the second half of the last century the degradation of the environment and the climate change caused by humans have increased at a rate never seen in any other time in history this is happy music what are the causes of the anthropocene there are two main ones the model of energy production and the resource consumption model the energy produced from coal oil and natural gas emits large amounts of greenhouse gases the main causes of global warming [Music] for its part the growing population needs a greater use of natural resources that nowadays surpasses the capacity of the earth to regenerate them these human actions cause among other consequences changes in the water cycle imbalances and destructions in the marine and terrestrial ecosystems the increase of extreme meteorological phenomena the acidification of the oceans or The Disappearance of the forests foreign is it possible to stop the devastating impact we are having on the planet yes although there are certain irreversible consequences we can still mitigate much of the damage caused to the environment it is necessary to tackle the problem at its root carbonizing the economy and relying on renewable and non-polluting energy sources such as the sun the water and the wind also making a responsible and equal use of Natural Resources will help achieve a more sustainable system that can prevent the anthropocene from becoming the last era of our planet good luck with that um so the problem here is that I mean that's a really tight like most of that impact has happened within the last hundred years right so much like that we're able to have such a massive impact and that we are extracting energy and we're consuming these resources at a scale and scope that are really fast um and so we are caught up in these big patterns it's not clear like they're saying mitigation and sustainability this is this Net Zero stuff that I talked about before it's it's they're Frameworks that still imply that we can we have at least some level of sustainability I I don't know where that comes from I I don't have any evidence of it I understand it that we want to have our systems be sustainable but I watch you know houses in my area get torn down and huge ones put up over and over again and that we take this arable land and we turn it into these things I just don't have a ton of evidence that we're moving quick enough the rate of change are we making the mitigation efforts quick enough to offset the impact that we're having and then I mean you can talk about eroi I won't do it I've done it introduce yours but um it it takes a lot of energy to build a new electric car um if we're not we don't have cars at all that would be a movement in the right direction but just differently powered cars I'm not sure the rate of change is going to be faster than the impact we're having on the environment so the premise here is still that we've got a monotheistic view of the planet there's a singular world that humans have the right to extract um and that this domain for human exploitation I don't know maybe humans are just this is just what human life is like if all life is trying to like store energy so that that species can live longer then we're doing a really good job at it it just happens to destroy the environment um and so this idea of humans as the next kind of extinction level event we've had several before um we've had up to 99 percent of the life destroyed on the planet several times I think we've got five or six extinction level events in the past um and so if the humans are part of the natural world is that natural world just the next extinction level event it would cause us harm clearly because we would be extinct but it's not clear that the Earth wouldn't continue on without us and so we we'd like to argue that climate change isn't a choice but at this point everybody's been given the evidence and the data and they're making some changes but they're clearly not making radical changes so I'm just not sure about this idea that we can mitigate quickly enough um and so maybe we just need to think in different scales about different species like about who's going to live and who's going to die like in a pinch of garden soil a gram and weight there are millions of bacteria representing several thousand species many of them unknown to science the life of the ground level is a random mix of species not just fungi bacteria worms it's everything and so maybe we're just one of these species alongside the millions we don't know and therefore the extinction of one of us is not the extinction of of all of them um and so I mean this is John Green just talking about like one of these ideas about how drastic the change in the life like just the mass the biomass the mammals on the planet has been in this short period I'll maybe skip ahead a bit where he's talking about the specifics of it one of the best things that can happen to me happened to me this morning and it is thus I was on Twitter and I saw this tweet from Hannah Richie it shows current mammal biomass so this is the amount of mammal biomass that is people this is the amount that is livestock including including pets just less than one percent over there this up here just four percent of the total mammal biomass is all wild mammals including whales and then I tweeted what I thought was a throwaway this makes me wonder how much mammal biomass has increased overall since agriculture like it definitely wasn't this much but was it less or way less and then I scrolled down and she had posted the answer in response to a different person I had this question that I thought was unanswerable and it turns out one it's been answered in two it's fascinating over here is total memo biomass 100 000 years ago it dropped a lot because humans killed a lot of animals in the Americas but right now humans alone are three times more biomass than all mammals on earth a hundred thousand years ago that's Wild so this idea that we are about just in terms of like just the existence of humans regardless of everything else we all go vegan tomorrow we just eat grass whatever um we still have more biomass now on the planet than we had a hundred thousand years ago so what I don't know about this notion of uh sustainability um and that maybe like we are just part of an if we really want to be part of an ecosystem you know eight percent of our DNA is the remnants of ancient viruses and 40 is is genetic material that has a viral origin we don't know about so we actually don't know a whole lot about ourselves genetically and we're just not clear about how much of his is nature the bulk of us is is made up of bacteria and things that aren't human DNA there are other things and so we like to think of ourselves as coherent holes but if we start messing with the scale we could see ourselves as the source of a whole bunch of bacteria and therefore maybe we aren't the ones that are supposed to survive at some other element of us that's supposed to it's messed up this is the weird part about this is taking this um political ecology to its kind of its conclusions
 okay Welcome to our discussion of political ecology um so yeah we skipped a couple chapters here because honestly the chapters were very good they were very abstract um and so I really felt like those the political order and the um ipe chapters would have been very abstract and not very useful and we we've got more specific examples here and then I just added a topic it it could rotate year to year but the idea being we just put nuclear in this year I guess you know um Oppenheimer coming out some some you know way of framing these issues so this chapter again you know we have the base text but I'm going to add quite a bit to it because we don't have any examples we need examples um so we're going to develop this idea of political ecology um and my kind of take on what what they mean by that um they're going to try to talk about how it transforms the discipline of political science I mean everybody says that look it's shiny and new provide examples of the way political ecology understand issues sure uh critical ecological issues sure and engage political ecologists okay so uh political ecology is a newcomer to political scientists um I don't think that's actually true I think there's a long history and tradition of people engaging with these things critically I think this is a narrow reading of political sciences science and I also think it's constructivist which is to say it wants to say things are constructed but again it needs to supplement its normative framework and we'll see that it runs in the same problem as as we ran with into like with constructivism before this one is more post-structural but it's it's still the same issue um absolutely this is a an issue that's at the Forefront of everything so I do think it could be a framework for understanding I just don't know if it's the best way to conceptualize these issues because of the problems that we'll talk about in a second um so the textbook talks about how the idea um of of these issues are coming forward and political science isn't very well equipped to deal with them and I agree all right uh climate refugees and migrants are going to be an issue I'll talk a bit about that um the idea of environmental justice so moving beyond Justice as a kind of adjudication between just I don't know humans in terms of crimes or intergenerational or those type of things will go to a broader framework and then food democracy I'll talk a bit about and we've already talked about extractivism so I don't think we need to get too much into that um and so the idea here is that political ecology as as a you know the method masquerading as a theory it's trying to say that it doesn't displace the core concerns of political science such as class gender race sexuality State institutions interests and Norms it brings the ecological relationships in and provides multiple axes of analysis okay but what are you doing right we don't really have a good sense of that there are ways in which people are doing things but I'm not sure that this political ecology approach is making it clear what the conflict is the conflict between humans and the environment or is the conflict between humans who conceptualize themselves outside the environment or inside the environment right we don't know um and so part of what it's doing here is saying that and I agree with this the idea that political science has as traditionally undervalued and not actually thought about conceptually um the biophysical world as separate from human interest and concern and so when we're talking about cycles of reproduction regeneration chemical and physical Dynamics these things happen regardless of whether or not humans are here and so the conceptualization then is that if those things are happening then is the human intervention separate from those things or part of those things and so this is the the concept of the anthropocene I'll talk a bit about um it's this framework of where should we fit humans in in this web of social relationships so traditionally because of the long history of both monotheism and the abrahamic tradition and the Western World and this doesn't apply to and I'll I've got examples with the heart and Ashanti of the ways in which we don't have to privilege ourselves above but we could be alongside anyways we have in the past privileged ourselves as above the natural world um and so this creates all sorts of problems if we want to displace that so if we want to say that humans are just alongside all the biological processes in the world it raises an immediate logical problem because if humans are part of the natural world then what they're doing is natural even if it's resulting in the destruction of the natural world because as in this framework in the anthropocene framework humans represent an extinction level event we are just the next one we are the next meteoroid that's hitting the Earth and wiping out stuff and whatever lives after it will continue to live of and so this is the problem of this this it they try to I guess what they're trying to do with the political ecology thing is convince us that this is like a it's an important approach but it's not radical but if we take it to its logical outcomes this is quite radical and so this is the idea of of um whether or not we can actually choose Extinction and so I don't know this is a un thing with Jack Black talking about this idea [Music] you okay you need a minute cool listen up people I know a thing or two about Extinction and let me tell you and you kind of think this would be obvious going extinct is a bad thing and driving yourselves extinct in 70 million years that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard at least we had an asteroid what's your excuse you're headed for a climate disaster and yet every year governments spend hundreds of billions of public funds on fossil fuel subsidies imagine if we had spent hundreds of billions per year subsidizing giant meteors that's what you're doing right now think of all the other things you could do with that money around the world people are living in poverty don't you think helping them would make more sense than I don't know paying for the demise of your entire species let me be real for a second you've got a huge opportunity right now as you rebuild your economies and bounce back from this pandemic this is Humanity's big chance so here's my wild idea don't choose extinctions save your species before it's too late it's time for you humans to stop making excuses and start making changes thank you [Music] thank you I mean so this is the question that we have is when we talk about scales we like to think about humans as the having the capacity to choose based on the current evidence we don't have a ton of evidence that people are going to choose the right path to Stave off coming problems I'm not sure we have any historical evidence that people choose the right path they probably don't have the time scale to understand themselves in context or environment we live in a time scale that's relatively well it's defined by our own lifespan and maybe those of our those who came before us and immediately after us but we have very little memory of two and three and four generations ago when so when you're talking about a 70 million year time span it's not at all clear that like individual choice is going to matter very much so the problem here is that when we think about political ecology they're they're taking in a specific way to try and frame it as it's obvious that these are these situations I'm not sure it is so sure the social natural worlds are co-determining each other in the past we've seen it as the social World determines the natural world right um the idea of you using scale is this idea that that these are big time scales we're talking about 70 million years is very different than you know humans moving this all of this way in a very quick time scale um it's interdisciplinary sure we you know not there isn't one field that can deal with climate change issues it's it's all of them um reworks theoretical approaches maybe I'm not really sure and I'm not sure how because again I don't know like are we saying that people aren't going to choose Extinction are you convincing them is do we have evidence that that's the case we have lots of evidence that there's climate change denialism right so which one wins out like we hope that we choose it but I'm not sure that we can right like I'm sure we have enough evidence to to support that position so um it has an explicit normative commitment I'm not sure what this means or which ones and takes a post-positive approach now this I kind of agree with it kind of not positivism in case you don't know is just the idea that there's an objective reality that we can measure and test and verify using often quantitative methods quantitative things that could be measured that have a value associated with it which is okay except when it comes to climate change it's hard right because it's it's at a scale that we can't reduce to easy numbers and so it's not at all clear like that we're not dealing with a qualitative problem and we're coming at it with quantitative framings right and so post positivism then acknowledges multiple realities and the role is subjectivity so Us in in the system not just looking at the system without us in it and I feel that that's what that video is doing it's saying hey look the problem's out there we can fix it in here and then make it work out there well we're probably in in it allows for Theory generation and qualitative exploration and uses a broader range of methods sure so it tries to because if you're dealing with stories and subjective it's not clear and so the problem is the central one which is are these little subjective one in eight billion can one in eight billion make good decisions for the 8 billion or would they make with the decisions for the one and so just because something socially interpreted doesn't mean it's unreal climate change is greenhouse gas emissions causes illness because some species go extinct ecosystems can absorb stress tropical Force disappearing um you know it's this constant Foundation of political dispute and so when we come and here's the positivist problem at the outset this has been the case over and over again is that as this video talk about climate refugees don't exist they don't exist not because it's not a problem that that is going to happen it's that our current framework legal framework and understanding for refugees requires political persecution for them to claim Refugee status otherwise they're just you know forced migrants or some form of migration and so we haven't even set up the framework to do this in part because we can't determine individual responsibility for climate change we can't say that Canada has contributed directly to this person leaving this place in which case we will not establish legal and political responsibility for the relationship again between the political outcome and the citizens who caused it so we can absolutely say that like we're contributing to global climate change as percentages as you know CO2 production but we can't prove any with any correlative Foundation that it was you know this straw that you threw out that led to the sea turtle getting it stuck of its nose and so we have these these issues at the center it does not actually exist in international law a refugee is defined as a person who has crossed an international border defined by the 1951 Convention as owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion and crossing a border Island country's borders yeah 80 pound scenes in Australia offer a glimpse into the future bushfires have been burning since September dozens of people have died forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria have been raised some blazes were so monstrous they created their own weather patterns causing dried lightning and fire tornadoes we have an autistic mini extreme event it was floods that have impacted routes that have impacted people around the world in terms of migration of people it's entirely possible large parts of Australia will be uninhabitable in the decades to count even the Prime Minister appears to be changing his stance and acknowledging the climate crisis as a national initiative we would I think want to have a higher level of confidence that as a nation we are improving our resilience and our adaptation to respond to the reality of the environment in which we live okay resilience and adaptation are both other euphemisms for we might do something but we're not sure we're going to do that much um so this is a problem then if we can't prove in a way that's going to establish a political like even if you have all the data in front of you you people deny data all the time right the rhetoric takes over from the reason and this tension that we've seen throughout the course is that just because there's reasonable evidence doesn't mean people are going to politically choose it right um and so ideas like food democracy great I sure radical transform our social organization we know that Farmers Feed cities that we are you know 98 of us are dependent on the two percent that produce this stuff the problem is is that we've created systems for example that that four companies based in the U.S control over 80 percent of the world's Seed Market 25 of agrochemical Market I've got this too I didn't include it in this lecture but you can look at almost every major food production industry is largely concentrated in the hands of a big company so we want to have food democracy but you're talking like what what are you saying are you saying socialism communism back to those questions fascism eco-fascism like I don't know what the argument is here six corporations hand it handle 85 percent of World Trade and grain 15 between the 95 percent of the coffee sales and the farm subsidies like built into this framework are Farm subsidies for the EU and USA which then have to compete elsewhere in the world and the easiest way to compete elsewhere in the world is to literally a burn down uh trees turn it into Farmland so you've got something that you've got like in the Amazon for example you've got all of this space that you can just raise in order to create Farmland in order to convert that Farmland into meat and so we've seen this we don't have any evidence that since 61 that's the growth of meat consumption by region meat production and consumption it's shooting up all over the place and so the the soy that is used to feed cows is the primary driver of what's happening to the Amazon so it's our food systems are the ones that are doing this and they're heavily concentrated so if they're concentrated we don't get a say in it it's up to those actors and and the states who regulate them in order to do this on top of that it's not at all clear that we're efficient with our food um the there's a religion handbook on food waste and if you go back over the kind of anthropo anthropological record humans have never been good at at saving food we throw out listen when it was small scale it makes a certain amount of sense okay if you throw out food waste it goes into the ground other animals eat it blah blah goes back into the ecosystem so when we were you know when our population was in the millions it might not have had as much environmental impact but when we're talking about billions and we're talking about this massive increase in all of that food is is made with energy massive increase in energy consumption to to feed eight billion people and then we throw out about a a third of all the food that we grow you're talking about huge impact tax on the environment that are not being made by a collective decision per se they're being made by eight billion individuals making food choices and so I don't think you want and I I don't have any evidence that you are supporting governments imposing veganism on everybody you're still making an individual choice and so we're not sure that individual choices are the best ways to deal with these Collective action problems and it's not clear that this framework or any framework is going to address that tension between the individual choice and the collective outcome
 we can link these patterns back to things that we tend to identify in politics all the time these Concepts aren't particularly I would say well-defined um in that the relationship between these two ecologically is clearly linked to extractivism right this damagement of lands from settlements uh commercial Agriculture and research extraction I'm not I don't know how much the concepts themselves can be ecologically unpacked the colonial relationships span pre-industrial to Industrial eras so they still have this element of hierarchy but that I don't I am hesitant to say that everything looks the same in all these experiences over space and time and so the idea of of moving with one framework to say colonialism and imperialism lead to development which leads to this is probably more complicated than that um clearly the colonies have different experiences with development different relationships to Colonial powers and then different roles in Food Systems and the production of of uh forms of natural resources that are extracted some can make money off at some can't some are subject to biopiracy some are the places where crops are are farmed sugar cane cocoa rum whatever that Dynamic is is probably different and to to hit them with all the same label is probably not a good understanding of these relationships and so what we do know about colonialism imperialism these forms of hierarchy going back in time is that they have produced this outcome right the richest 10 percent are responsible for all of almost half of total lifestyle consumption emissions and the bottom uh 50 are only responsible for 10. so that does imply some political responsibility but I don't know what that means for our food systems and our systems of extraction how much water should you wash your jeans there's an argument you put them in the freezer right you shouldn't use them they use a huge amount of water they have a huge amount of CO2 but they last a long time they're they're not disposable they're probably better than fast fashion stuff from Zara or whatever um you know does this change how we think what we should eat and who should eat and what kind of um products have the biggest impact um does it matter that these relationships are impacting things like bees and insects are seeing these massive declines and so the problems then for political science are framed in terms of this crisis I don't know when it starts and I don't know how we distinguish between what was a colonial and Imperial and the settler Colonial experiences on an impact how we think about these things so so if we are this sixth Max Extinction event we've have these collapse in all these species we have different actors trying to respond to this and then these moral considerations about decentering the human perspective and then the non-human species stuff you know granting protected status to spaces and environments right um you know we're pledging to stop this but we're still running out um these are you know hot spots in the the uh um intensified Amazon rainforest and then the question becomes okay so what should our relationship to these events be um and I I am sympathetic to to both sides of this debate here this don't look up moment is shockingly similar to the real life UK news clip trying to tell you that the entire planet is about to be just be destroyed well it's um you know just something we do around here you know we just keep the bad news light right it helps the medicine go down oh you see John You're outside enjoying the sunshine it's not too hot is it I can see in front of me are frightening so we all like nice weather but this will not be nice weather this will be potentially lethal weather for a couple of days it'll be brief but it'll be brutal I want us to be happy about the weather maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn't supposed to be fun I don't know whether Something's Happened to meteorologists to make you all a little bit fatalistic and and harbing is a doom because all of the broadcasts particularly on on the BBC every time I've turned on anyone's talking about the weather they're saying that there's going to be tons of fatalities but haven't we always had hot weather but heat waves are becoming more extreme this is yet another one which is coming down the track towards us and you know I don't think we should be too lighted light-hearted about the fact that many are going to die early next week because of the heat 40 degrees the sort of temperature of this country I'm afraid it's just not geared up to cope with so we have this issue or these are old standing problems and then we are presented with the evidence and we're like ah don't worry about it and so that beneficial system I'm not sure like can you honestly I don't know like it's tough when you look at these numbers and we are mostly in the Western World sitting up here do we ask nicely um how does this happen that's what I mean about this political ecology I think we're caught in the same Fabian socialism of the UN we know there's a problem here's a problem but we have to choose the right way to respond to it and when we're forced to choose between like having a hamburger or not we choose the hamburger and we enjoy it there's nothing wrong I think with enjoying things it's just I'm not sure that the individual choice is going to be mitigated quick enough to deal with these deep systemic social crisis and glowing growing inequality and those who benefit from that inequality have all the hierarchy mechanisms in them and so this idea of of pollution happening you know industrial pollution agricultural runoff is is producing this um we're losing massive jellyfish blooms huge carbon sinks coral reef despairing my father-in-law is he's a marine geologist has done nothing but examine coral reefs um and you know uh sunscreen right sunscreen is just brutal for coral reefs you're not supposed to wear it but I I get sunburned easily it's a tough one to call and so do we are we going to frame this and we've had there's already a subset of political science literatures looking about water conflicts right the ways in which water exacerbates but isn't seen as directly causing conflict it just makes conflictual situations worse we have this problem of waste of the food supply of um you know the US is five percent of the world population produces 30 of its garbage this idea that we throw out landfill we're doing stuff we see it in the store all the time you know the the banged up groceries we just don't like to do it and then these questions about recycling been you can look up in your individual Community but often recycling bins just end up in waste because when China decided for example it's not going to recycle cardboard anymore we ran into this problem where our perverse outcomes are that it's cheaper to produce new cardboard in terms of energy and cost than it is to recycle it and so we get these weird inversions that happen E-Waste you know everybody producing 176 pounds per year often hazardous we get toxic trade and Asbestos and DDT these things banned and that these it you can't really see it here but the if you look at the change of price of certain things the things that are the cheapest are the things that cause the most E-Waste so how often do you go through a phone the planned obsolescence of your phone we used to say the planned Ops lessons of vehicles was gross the planned obsolescence of phones with all these things in it and then this extractivism right I talked about this before about the idea that a lot of the Canadian economy is built on the extractivism in in places like Africa and so how how would we change those systems in terms of air pollution and climate change all of these mechanisms should come in and then we made a lot of headways with things like the Montreal protocol and then we found out um we were stopping the CFC chlorofluorocarbons that were leading to a buildup of heat in the atmosphere and we had made a lot of progress on it but then when they did a survey with satellites they found out that just two places in looks like China and then that must be off the coast of South Korea there one of the islands they were leaking CFCs at massive levels but if we didn't surveil them we wouldn't have known this and so we can move forward but we have to be vigilant and I'm not sure how Vigilant we are those scientists discovered it from satellite imagery it wasn't something that was discovered by Chinese regulation and so this idea of melting ice as a threat to coastal cities we see this already in places like Miami with flooding and collapses and stuff like that all those ways in which we do it so how do we fix these things well more often than not we go back to the state we try to do it in terms of things like ecological citizenship which then creates all of these weird eco-fascist things that we've talked about throughout the course this idea that good citizens versus bad citizens and gosh knows how that's going to go um and then carbon democracy this idea of that we should have more equitable distribution or Equitable claims but again I don't know what these look like in terms of of forcing political Solutions or making these Solutions we have this idea oh there's a type of other steady state growth these efforts to Green the state Green State but we don't have any examples currently of a green State we have environmental welfare states like Sweden and the Netherlands pushing towards Eco modernization and then we have market-based Solutions like Australia and the USA trying to push towards those we just don't know if these these mechanisms these political mechanisms we have are are well suited to fixing these problems and so the idea then of of the first world having to pay its Fair fair share would require us to you know do things like pay taxes which you don't even want to do so this idea of the ecological Foundation of North American of sprawl consumer capitalism expansion is all bound up in things like the growth of urbanization urbanization is from our food systems if you've only got two percent producing the food 98 is pushed into cities which means we're then more dependent on those cities over and over when those cities grow and take up arable Farmland we're one of those problems we talked about before and so by 2030 you know 60 of the the population will be in urban areas and one in three will be in a city of fifty thousand or more which makes us more dependent on these systems pursuing ideas like pushing us to more ecologically sustainable systems doesn't make sense if we're living in cities and so slums then could be a kind of failure on both levels of of the kind of the product of of modernization of development um and that we increasingly don't put infrastructure and we're not developing Green State mechanisms and then this idea of how we should think about the right to housing and what's an ecologically sound right to housing and who should deal with it and so the global climate change crisis is this idea that political science should be dealing with these issues we should do this interdisciplinary stuff um but we have this political economy of climate change denialism um that we have Global Justice movements but we that small group at the top is going to have to to deal with this and this bifurcation that the West does is between we want to see two because it's easier to see two sides rather than see like the all of the issues that are involved in these things and so we see conflict coming from global climate change but we're not sure those mechanisms are resulting in change that one's really sad um and so the idea then is that we've got all political parties then in our oppositional systems not all agreeing even on the the fundamental premise right the more that these um organizations and these mobilizations argue that humans are still the center of the system and we should primarily be concerned with what humans and humans do and what's best for maximizing human benefit is countered to all of these other questions and so the power of rhetoric is still here we don't need which science alone is not enough to convince us we have to mobilize those political systems in order to make us consensus building and I'm not sure that we are at a point of consensus building and so the idea of irrefutable evidence doesn't have anything to do with politicization the politicization of evidence is going to involve reason versus rhetoric and so they democracies in particular have been fairly successful with using rhetoric to counter reason and so those are all examples uh the Alberta conservatives Trump and voluncero while doing this versus these youth voters demanding action in terms of these issues so political ecology introduces these Concepts and ideas I'm not sure it provides what it says it will which is it ends up in a Fabian socialist outcome where we know we need to take change but we're not sure what we're willing to do to to take it we're not sure which commitments we're willing to make in order to do that are we talking about Green state are we talking about what social welfare Estates are we talking about ecological modernization through the markets and so all of these things would imply that we need to change our hierarchies and consider the rights of non-human species I'm just not sure how many of you are willing to do that and as a consequence of that then we want to have this this emergence of the political Ecology of health because increasingly climate change and health are interrelated and that ecology and ecological economics are in here um but we don't have any better systems than we had in week one of dealing with the idea that some people are going to make claims that are accepted by them the those who are the dominant group or the the largest group in the hierarchy and everybody else who doesn't have access to those resources and so we end up in that space again
 okay uh Welcome to our discussion of the politics of race um I'm not going to be able to I mean every field is dealing with their own framings of race in their own particular ways um this chapter I'm going to supplement like many of the others it's very abstract because it doesn't want to get caught in the weeds though it goes specific in some weird sections as well um these this I mean as I've as we talked in the previous lectures like a lot of these relationships the settlement of North America is linked to um this triangle trade the trade of goods the The Furs in particular beaver pelts going back to England which was then traded over to Africa which then brought bodies um for the slave trade to the Caribbean and to North America and so this integral patterns of trade still tends to follow those routes to the this day now um yeah my subject positioning I think we should all be conscious of our subject positioning who we are where we're from um what our attitudes are and and how they impact how we think about things because that's what we're doing this week we're taking some of those liberal Concepts and ideas that we discussed previously and situating them in context right so um I've written on Race a couple times engaging with the concepts thinking about my own subject positioning how that functions how we think about these how we teach and how we learn about this and whether or not we're capable of learning we have to be open to learning we have to recognize a couple different things so I've written recently about it in the context of covid but also in the context of teaching about race is that particularly those with privilege should absolutely be spending their time and resources thinking about these things because that privilege comes from this exact kinds of hierarchy right um and so what I say when I'm saying subject positioning all that I'm saying is is that we have to not assume an absent subject or this kind of idealized universal subject of the liberal political framing the one that is the autonomous individual who mixes their labor with land in order to create property but to recognize no that I had parents or I have people who raised me I have those who care for me those who contribute to my well-being and contribute to my mental health and that they are implicated in my success or failures in the positive and negative and so my subject positioning is always going to be implicated in those and that's also to return to this idea from shilliam we have the suppressor in all of us right that we reflect majoritarian sensibilities in our social facticity or the ways in which we just do the ways in which we are I can't undo those ways in which those privileges reflected through me but I should be conscious and develop everybody should have those tools to to challenge us so my ability to enter a washroom unchallenged is is a clear sense of privilege and that's going to reflect a normativity inherent in my subject in in who I am and how I do things um my ability to resolve issues or the ability to resolve issues by calling the police is a clear part of the settler and of the white settler majoritarian sensibility the idea of not to be challenged or treated as suspicious in certain contexts or Frameworks is all linked into that and so I'm not going to tell other people about their subject positioning or experiences what I'm going to do is try to bring in as much as I can the ways in which I can amplify those voice choices and this is a practice this is his thing and we're always going to mess up at it I'm going to have to try better and do better all the time this kind of practices of amplifying voices deferring voices and citing those voices that can speak more eloquently or better or from a position of experience that I don't have because of my own subject position so when we're talking about the learning objectives for this chapter we're really trying to delve into what has largely been an unexamined concept which is that of Canadian conceptualizations of race the ways in which race is deployed or racialization is deployed and then how those are embedded in structures attitudes and institutions and forms of racism we are going to challenge this object this absent subject this absent Canadian subject that has a raceless colorblind race neutral attitude we're going to link those to Scientific racism colonialism imperialism and our own Academy and Western itself we have these legacies they're ongoing their practices that continue they're not in the past these are never in the press and so white cellular societies are constantly remaking these categories of normativity when I am able to do things are not able to do things I'm remaking those categories so we have to be critical of that we have to think of the ways in which they're embedded in in kind of discussion legislation and what we're trying to do in political science remember if we're if we're teaching those who are in power we are teaching forms of hierarchy which also means we're teaching forms of marginalization and often oppression and so we can highlight these racialized discourses and then we can talk a bit about the emergence in the 2020 I don't know why that would matter I guess it's just because of the mobilization around it but mobilization around an issue shouldn't be why we address the issue it should be because the issue is there and is important and so I've added in some Concepts throughout um this week to give a little more context um and and to frame these and to link into our next two weeks discussion so that of the what I've been arguing the other absent subject is is the gendered and sexed subjects um they're just totally absent here um as well as forms of intersectionality um tend to be we've weirdly compartmentalized bodies and so I've got a tick tock that talks about that as well it tries to oversimplify it so um I I do want to talk about I think there are elements that have to be understood as Canadian senses of race and racism and the ways in which Canada in particular using multiculturalism has used that as an impediment to think about racial hierarchy and racial Construction in the way in which race is deployed um and that you know this these questions of race disrupt the kind of politics of as usual and let's do it like absolutely so I don't know more Truth and Reconciliation black lives matter but also we've got anti-asian racism in the context of covid we've got islamophobia and anti-Semitism and then the the kinds of normative oppression that come for intersectional bodies we won't talk about it as much this week but next week we'll definitely get a two-spirit non-binary lgbtqi those ways in which these things and that's why I'm a little hesitant to take them apart because when we put them all together that intersectionality results in overlapping forms of discrimination and oppression that I perpetuate when I speak and do things and have the capacity to do so and it is Amplified especially for let's say um intersectional bodies or non-binary bodies in the context of you know gender norms and then of racial Norms as well and so that's going to be a problem now the key thing to think this isn't in the textbook but this is a key way to think about this W.E DuBois this is written in 1935. um this is Political Science this is as canonical to political science as could be and it's largely been whitewashed literally eliminated from our teaching for the last Almost hundred years so this existed this is there's lots of this it's been around and one of the Frameworks that comes out of this is that the deployment of remember the the concept of of race as a form of categorization doesn't emerge until the 1600s or so and when it does emerge it has to be deployed politically so it takes time and takes different ways and which is done and so what Dubois is talking about is this theory of race is that as it's a slowly evolved mechanism of kind of social factitity of the ways in which like ideas get concretized in brains and then police bodies and then say what is permissible and not right swimming pool politics in the states um the ways in which this is has happened over time and so what he his Insight was from the the 30s in particular was looking at kind of sociologically looking at the experiences of those bodies in the U.S particularly in the U.S South that have by all kind of marxist definitions or class definitions no clear demarcation between them they are both poor um they have about the same political agency they're largely in the same conditions they have the same level of Education same attitudes all the rest all the rest of that and we'll come back to this as we go but as I've already talked about this last week about the idea of Christians how do we distinguish between types of Christians when the former slaves and the white workers are both Christians and so what he says is they have practically identical interests um that there's there's nothing that sees either a part and so what happens then is that the white group of laborers they receive a low wage as well but they're compensated in a form of public and psychological wage they're given public deference and titles because they were white so we just give them something to split these two groups that are otherwise indistinguishable from by giving them these characteristics that they were admitted freely with all the classes of white people the public functions public parks and the best schools so race is deployed specifically through it always has been through things like washrooms through things like public spaces through like access to education those are are ways in which we do it we make sure that the police are drawn from the ranks and the courts reflect them and the voting reflect affects them and that public officials reflect that voting and then we produce newspapers that specialize on news that flatters those poor whites and ignores the the black bodies the brown bodies in the American system accepting crime and ridicule and so this is the deployment of race as a category as a way as a lived experience as a way of thinking and so this here is just a funny Tick Tock from this Creator talking about the ways in which he he says he's he's had to do it so often and so like this has been around since 1935 right like this should be kind of Common Sense stuff and he's having to do it so often and he produces this so often that he tries to dumb down the ways in which uh race and gender and class are deployed in order to understand kind of intersectional experiences so he does it in the kind of the most oversimplified caveman way of producing this these ideas I thought that perhaps I had dumbed it down to the dumbest and easiest level but now we are going to do misogynoir for cavemen black have oppression woman have oppression black women have oppression unique to black woman not simply black oppression or woman oppression new black woman oppression black man having so let's be clear we'll come back to this but Kimberly Crenshaw when she came up with the idea of intersectionality was literally using the metaphor of an intersection whereby black oppression and women's oppression was being treated separately by the courts so much so that they couldn't cover black women's oppression because it was either framed as black oppression or women's oppression and so he's making that distinction here and then we'll continue with this unique oppression black woman have unique oppression both under white oppression white oppression like Swiss army knife many tools many black men try to put away racism but keep patriarchy many black women point out whole tool point out patriarchy hurt black woman black man  about accountability black man very unwilling to part with patriarchy white woman buddy up for convenience white men stay winning black man very unwilling to say patriarchy band black man want Power low-key like white man from patriarchy big problem for black man because it don't work that way anytime black woman point this out black man get very angry black men say guess we blame black man now black man still won't let go of patriarchy black man black woman have other dynamics that if me no make a side four people get pedantic however me point is in-game should not be patriarchy go-to black man in game should be throwing out Swiss army knife if me hear one more comment say take accountability black woman me drop Boulder on head so just this idea so there's a whole bunch of Concepts here that I'm not going to be able to get into in the main lecture I'll add them as an appendix I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that yet but there are many many different dynamics that we just simply don't have the time or place to get into so I'll just kind of put them in a supplementary some of those I mean one of of appropriation of colorism which leads into beauty standards code switching the ability to partake in different majoritarian and minority communities based on how we communicate and the the culture and the expressions from those different majority and minority communities which of course produces majoritarian sensibilities about what should be done that result in things like microaggressions small forms of of hostility towards attitudes and opinions that are not of the majority right we also have intergenerational differences for communities that have migrated or come over and the way they experience race and racism expatriates the concept of expatriates versus immigrants as a kind of global mechanism of of the ways in which we think about white supremacy the racism of design and we'll get into it a bit but this is a fascinating area which I mean Architects architectural issues public issues I've talked about before with the anti-homelessness stuff has been in that and then this persistent problem particularly in political science I'll take the most accountability for that one of the Devil's Advocate right of of taking the abstract subject positioning of well I don't believe this but what if this person did that right that comes immediately from this idea that well I don't have to speak from my experience I'll speak from someone else's experience and I'm not doing that in good faith because I actually want to hear the response I'm doing it in bad faith because it makes you defend a position that no one took in order to waste your time and resources rather than dealing with the issue and so that's what he's getting at the end of the video there again with this idea of respectability and accountability about creating situations where someone has to take accountability and responsibility for something when you don't have to do it at all because you've just played the position of Devil's Advocate and so this is the the the problem is that you know it it cuts both ways in this 20 20 60 of Canadians say racism is a serious problem in Canada so this comes out from that but it's only 60 but at least it's 60 I don't know whether how to understand that um I don't really understand this framing of Canadians starting to identify things for what they are the smacks of a crass materialism as if we're not constantly generating new ways to be racist and new ways to challenge um uh those who would call out forms of hierarchy and oppression um and so this idea of racial transformation transformation and this great social transformation is really just about we've always spoken race we just have spoken it from largely majoritarian sensibilities and refused to listen to non-majoritarian sensibilities um so the ways in which colonialism and white supremacy are kind of bound up in in How We Do politics and that racial justice as as a form of um I mean it's always been an issue with the ways in which we're pushing that issue to be acknowledged and reconciled with at the outset that's why it's in an intro to politics discussion right is it has to be here and it's taking more of a foreground at the outset and so what this is then is about the majority starting to recognize the ways in which it's implicated in forms of race and racism and which is ways it's just refused to in the past so this is Dr Deborah Thompson from McGill and this is her on I think it's the talk or whatever it is the the Canadian morning talk show talking about Canada in particular we were talking about in Canada and I was like Jed have you noticed that I'm the only not white person in this bar and she kind of like stopped and she turned in a circle and she then was like no I I didn't notice at all and to me it's that it's that ability to not notice your whiteness that's the invisibility right it's it's both invisible and it's ubiquitous I don't get to not notice that I'm black that's not something that's possible for me so it's that ways in which this is reproduced and reproduced tacitly and reproduced explicitly reproduced in simple things like what things we memorialize what things we count which cannons we count which voices we listen to which books we read and how that's reproduced and so this has been the great consternation the textbook talks about it quite a bit but we'll go through it as well um with Johnny McDonald um the the idea that we have one of the founders of this nation being an avowed racist at the time uh somewhere I've got it right here so much so that his contemporaries in Parliament were shocked at his racism he was the only one who would use the term Aryan in the 1870s and 1880s and the only member to argue that like different groups were different species and stuff and so this idea then of of him proposing like these these people not having to write the right to vote because they were foreigners was his greatest Triumph and that this idea of of adopting explicitly genocidal policies towards indigenous groups blaming groups for Insurrection and and uh calling for their extermination based on false premises and this Contra contradiction of even the attitudes and opinions at the time and so there's this this tendency to say that this was in the past and therefore because in the past we have learned from it I don't know of any kind of how way that you could conceptualize educational correlation to these things and this is why so this I I documented this I reported this page when it popped up just popped up a couple years ago on on our campus and it was taking something that went around at Berkeley and then framing it at Western as this idea of creating a white students union this this kind of mocking framing of white ignorance as if it could just equate whiteness as the same as other experiences and then produce that in a very specific way and so I don't know if there's any other evidence of that that might be the only evidence I have of that um but this is an ongoing practice on our campus at our school something we have to take seriously and something that isn't in the past but very much of the present
 so the textbook starts by Framing this great social transformation I mean I I don't know how you can assess great from inside great and I don't know how you assess it's new this idea of hyper diversity in urban centers I mean Constantinople like that this has been historically the case of urban centers have always been a place of convergence um and connection so the politics of Sidious assassin talks about the politics of cities in this long tradition of cities being sites of kind of different types of politics that you'll find elsewhere um and so we get then this majority minority um framing of issues um this kind of multiplicity of of racialized minorities constituting a majority of population I don't why I characterize this is so what they're trying to say here is more than 50 percent of people are becoming the that the groups of uh communities that have been traditionally marginalized or in the context of Canada have represented less than 50 percent of the population are now more than 50 percent of the population in other words the idea that the minority is the majority I don't think that that's how race functions it's not a numbers game it never has been hence Colonial India um it's been about hierarchies and power and the capacity to enforce minority uh a rule as if it's majority majoritarian sensibility so that's the settlement of Canada right settlers coming in and not having a numbers game but still claiming that indigenous communities don't have the right to representation under our social contract right um but there is and I I do think there should be and there has been a lot a series of long-standing critiques about multiculturalism going back to the discussion we had about the idea of Tolerance from roles for the liberal notion of Tolerance under pins multiculturalism so it has been criticized from left and right that the idea of Tolerance and multiculturalism doesn't actually result in a substantive engagement with those communities and what it does is it tolerates them and tolerance is supposed to breed the idea that we're going to get along but without engaging with those communities you're just kind of creating enclaves and you don't get a substantive agreement with it and what this does is produce in-group and out group dynamics so if the majority group or the one group is refusing to engage with the experiences of another group how is that resulting in some type of better understanding it can often just breed resentment and so it doesn't necessarily result in the idea of liberal progress right and so I'm not really sure we need any of this but it's this um this is the absent subject positioning of this chapter in other words Canadians the subtext of this chapter is Canadians are white now that Canadians are having to deal with the race let's deal with white anxieties as if that should be our primary concern right this generating anxieties and backlash listen whiteness has always been a source of anxiety for um people when they have to think about themselves as race when white people have to think about themselves as race it causes anger fear or aggression towards the notion of of that somehow their hierarchy and privilege isn't natural right it's always produces so we get white lash white rage all this these conspiracy theories about replacement stuff I'm just going to debunk those before we even go further I don't know why they platformed this I said I'm not sure why they platformed this I I just added this to the text in order to show that um all this replacement nonsense doesn't have anything to do with anything in that the idea that there's a population some type of population correlation to race or how we think about race we throw out a 1.3 billion of tons of food a year around the world uh a third of the food that we make just goes straight in the garbage which is to say that this is not about resources or the lack of capacity data resources even if we were a little bit more efficient with our food waste we would have more than enough capabilities for things to go around um you know the discussion about housing and stuff like that at the post-war era remember the the marginal tax rate on the richest was like 90 percent and there was a massive expansion of public subsidies into housing for War veterans so we created housing um by the government in order to provide resources for those people and so if the government chooses to build houses for people people have houses if we decide in the 1980s that the private Market is more efficient at allocating these resources we are going to have the provision of a tighter Supply in order to get a higher level of Demand right again those are aren't natural they're created by decisions the government doesn't intervene in order to create houses we have uh slower responses to this we don't have those resources we we don't get access to the spaces that people need to live right in terms of population and and population doubling it has gone up but it is decreasing and it has decreased so for a long time our our doubling time um when we went 10 000 BC was was very low by 2000 it had reached a kind of peak that we would double our population within 51 years but by 2025 we're seeing this decrease again and this specifically has to do with this idea of population growth as being somehow correlated to how we can think about things I had it last time right we could have billions and billions of people on the planet it's about the allocation of resources and the types of lifestyles in which they live and so this idea about fear about which population is growing or not growing or things like that there don't have anything to do we know the top 10 percent consume 90 of the resources that distribution problems have more to do with anything than than population population doesn't matter all of this comes from malthusian and Neo malthusian are arguments this idea of an imminent disaster that's being predicted about population has been predicted since 1798 emerges around the idea of the concept of race right the idea that there's certain communities that are growing faster than other communities and therefore that causes an imbalance again back to this idea that there should be a proper distribution but we have no idea what that is and so this idea that our population is growing too too fast or that we shouldn't have anything to do it that that somehow there's a fear here we've seen efforts to undertake efforts to control population so 38 of the global population is in China and India so if we want to talk about population control or ways in which we can think about which populations are growing which ones aren't both of these governments undertook around similar times efforts to control their population in India it was education so it was this idea of educating the poor that here's you know access to contraception and iuds um it didn't have any substantial impact on the society cultural attitudes and opinions impact how we think about production and and social reproduction so um you know this idea of children per woman from 1956 to 2000 was um the same but life expectancy um uh decreased over that same period so we didn't see a substantive change in um the idea of the reproduction of that this idea of uh the reproduction of the population it didn't substantively change whereas China actually did have substantive control they have a strong centralized authoritarian government they're in able to implement the one child policy and so they dropped from a 2.2 percent growth rate in 1970 to a less than one percent in 2000. this has become an issue the the one child policy was dropped because there's Now 50 million uh single males in Chinese society and the population is shrinking and so you can't have a growing economy with a shrinking population which is exactly what we see in the the west and this tension between how do we grow and not have these issues and so they implemented controls and they were successful but we don't know which one's more beneficial because now China's got this problem of they've removed this policy because they need this again and so this idea of how a population grows I mean an easy way that the Canada can grow its population is just double the number triple quadruple the number of immigrants we let in but then majoritarian sensibilities get you get bounced up against right um and so when we think about carrying capacity there's very little evidence of any specific amount of people that any country or place can have it has to do with the efficient allocation of resources and how we Define efficiency if everybody wants to have chicken we're not going to have an efficient allocation of resources that's just how it is and so why we perpetually have these debates about a replacement or population or all the rest of this in the context of race is it's a form of of in-group out-group sensibility if you you believe your population is good you're going to believe that the source of ills comes from another population Malthus was really concerned with there was too many poor people it wasn't that there were too many people it was there were too many poor people and so this is this is also what Foucault talks about with the emergence of the concept of race that as a categorization race was also meant to apply to lower classes and so the fear isn't just about the you know the phenotypical characteristics the skin characteristics of who's growing it's about the idea that they're not growing in the ways that we want right and so this goes back to the idea of improvement and development about who gets to decide who grows and how they grow they were he was mad that poor people had too many kids and they wanted to take their money away Galton said you know this struggle for uh existence this fear of overpopulation of the planet Marx just to argued it was a distribution problem and this goes to the fundamental question is what is the right level of population on the planet this is a famous quote from a political scientist who is like he he goes to um India and he says oh there's people and you eating washing and sleeping in public and there's people people as you move through their mob would we ever know all three of us were frightened and ever since that I've known the fear of population but as somebody else pointed out if you were in Times Square or New York or Piccadilly Circus in London since around this time like from the 1800s on since the enclosure movement on you would have seen this exact same circumstance but when people fear overpopulation they do it through racially coded lenses there's no way to think about what Society should look like without making a series of claims about your in-group position and the out group position and how they should be and so we'll see this over and over again we're seeing it in the current moment and we're seeing it specifically in relationship to the idea that and this goes back this is literally eco-fascism and this goes back to the Nazis and remember the Nazis board a lot of the Eugenics programs from America with that developed those in relationship to its long history of the plantation economy and so the idea here is that there was this fear that too many people would be um take up the living space or they were a threat to the culture and environment that in 1935 Germany first passed its conservation laws as well as a push for organic farming this idea that that in Nazi Germany this idea of the rapid urbanization and environmental degradation was a problem for Rural populations and that this was used in in the um the framework of the Charlottesville riots and that this is what this book is arguing as well is that we've got and there it is there in 2004 this is my quote that I pulled a group of Dutch authors recorded the estimates from 94 scientists what's the carrying capacity of the earth it ranges anywhere from 500 million to one sextillion 21 zeros there there's it just depends on how we organize our society about how many people can live in theory we've got the Sun and we've got it providing energy with us so if we really drop our energy consumptions and make sure we focus on the most efficient form of consumption we can have at you know that's what I mean one sextillion there is no scientific foundation for how many people we can have on the planet but what we're hearing over and over again in the context of global climate change is this idea then that somehow some groups are going to be responsible for the problems and other groups are going to respond to those problems and so that's really what we're getting at today is this in-group out group dynamics about what the actual problems are and how they are framed through ideas of race and specifically we're going to deal with these two questions one is there a distinctive Canadian politics of race racism and racialization and how as political science engage with the race question spoiler alert not well that we haven't really dealt with this um substantively and so the idea of of this persistent denial of it as even a subject is one of the primary problems that we have in political scientists I see it constantly this is a kind of constant an issue where people just simply think well my issue doesn't have anything to do with race it can't that just doesn't make any sense right it's not a sensible way it's the denial of the existence of race and the den this myth that Canada has a raceless past and so um specifically in in how we frame things this is the idea of the linking this back to specific liberal framings of the absent subject so I want to be one who respects human rights and everybody's specific experience and so I do that by saying I don't see race that I simply don't see it and the absurdity of that is that you do you absolutely do you participate in it and you normalize your through your white salafism these ways in which majoritarian sensibilities um permeate how we think about all aspects of things how we think about systemic racism as being something that exists or we deny it the institutional racism exist or we deny it the ways in which we've constructed things like I give a rant about pants the white uh Western experience of the idea that the business suit is a thing that we should all do and that the gray drab business suit is something that I participate in that I'm forced to participate into in order to attain respect and authority and that as a consequence of that then I participate my own oppression I hate pants and I can't do anything about it and and so this idea then about who's just great like there's no color it's just so boring right it's so boring and yet it's it's a tacit Norm right so that's a stupid absurd example of the kinds of ways in which these majoritarian sensibilities are perpetuated by everybody that we participate in them and they're culturally specific right like there's lots of different historical experiences about this but I can show you the G20 meetings G8 meetings about what they're wearing over and over again that Fashion Is perpetuated by this kind of weird domination of what should be and so supposed incompatibility of different cultural Traditions are framed then in terms of kind of a ideal or non-ideal superiority okay I'm going to stop here because it's likely I'll get a copyright strike on this video so I just I don't want to lose all the rest of the discussion we'll jump right into this idea of not seeing race
 so this is what the issue that we're talking about over and over again this isn't perfect it's a bit old but it's very much how Canada has framed these issues in the past and and how it thinks about the kind of liberal project of multiculturalism is that somehow that liberalism doesn't see or doesn't need to think race diverse movies yeah like Moonlight or lion hidden figures and fences movies that didn't like just feature white people so interesting I never really thought about really even after the whole Oscars so white thing and all the Articles written about it call me crazy but I okay races like often like a pretty obvious thing to observe it's not like racist to notice I had to laugh Zach um my goodness I only see one race the human race such you're only telling yourself that so you don't have to think about racism or confront your own prejudices no I'm not I'm a man Katie you know that no honestly I just guessed this is gonna sound nuts but I don't see gender and I don't see sex I just see people you don't see how men and women look different no I just see like shapeless blonde blonde okay and if one of those shapeless flops were pregnant you would then know that it was a woman to me it could just be okay so this is satirizing the the absent liberal subject position of not being able to see any specific um characteristics of bodies but I will argue hashtag male preg they're working on artificial uteruses and I probably would do it um I have a baby if I could so some of these assumptions are built into the way that we think about things and a lot of and we'll get into this next week and talk about gender a lot of these things are socially and technologically constructed as to how they're experienced so anyways we'll let it continue a big [Music] quality I'm just a good person unless you're blind you can tell that people have inherent differences oh wouldn't know if I was blind or not because I don't see disabilities I'm not a monster so if someone were in a wheelchair you wouldn't be able to see the wheelchair I ever seen never seen a wheel I don't know what a wheelchair looks like if you if someone were in a wheelchair you would not install a ramp in your building I would refuse what if someone was missing a limb it's perhaps tuck if someone were deaf talk with them as if they could hear why are you so proud of yourself okay well here's a thought maybe you don't get it because you have less experience on Earth than I do experience we're all older than but I don't see age oh come on you're telling me if there was an old woman and a baby you wouldn't be able to tell which one's older one of them is called an old woman it's in the name Katie no no believe in equality and I believe everyone is the same age that's not what equality means you have to women are my same age oh my God what about your parents how old were they when they had you I Christ Katie what else can you see pretty much everything baldness for example so Bruce Willis is he is he he's famously bald Kitty why are you doing okay I just want to be able to do and say whatever I want whatever I want and I don't want to have to think about the world's problems actually sounds pretty good I mean I guess I can understand that good way to live that's witnessed in a nutshell um it's also liberal teleology in a nutshell remember liberalism has no endogenous theory of violence right violence always comes from the the specific subjects not the idealized subject the universal subject is one without violence and race in class and and oppression it is one that is rising above and that will naturally lead to a better way of thinking this idea of progress right so she's bound up in that idea of progress because that idea of progress leaves all those questions behind specifically those questions for those in positions of authority and power that don't want to address right they don't ask it so this is denial this idea that we are a country without a history of racism we use American um kind of politics and because Canada Jim Crow 2 and our railroads and all the rest of it we use American experiences of the plantation system to deny the ways in which there were slaves deployed in Canada there were different ways in which we have always and continue to to undertake forms of racist depression right and so this idea of it is then we always want to particularize racism because liberalism can't theorize it right it can't come up with a concept of it doesn't know where it comes from it comes from culture history experience and the idealized subject doesn't have that they're Universal right and so what always ends up happening is we always say they're a bad apple they are a specific individual actor the original expression is the Bad Apple spoils the brunt Bunch which is to say that having one bad actor makes all the others bad but we misread that aphorism in order for it to just mean that there's only one and it's not systemic right we intentionally that is a form of ignorance itself an intentional misreading of the concept in which we are articulating in order to deny the existence of something we don't want to deal with because white people are uncomfortable thinking about their subject position they get defensive in Anger fear and guilt and we want this idealized egalitarian version of liberal democracy because we don't have to deal with the ways in which it's not not it's simply not that's not in history or practice the actual experience of how this thing works and so we like the idealized and political science to the extent that we're largely caught specifically political sciences cut between political theory and practice um we were caught in the middle of kind of doing politics where we're constantly doing this stuff and so this denial is at the heart of of liberalism this denial of the idea that we're articulating Universal rights but from fallible people who make mistakes and so the we're just denying the fallible people that make mistakes in order to understand well that's the goal the goal is that right this active creation of privilege in the choice of knowledge the active misreading of the Bad Apple aphorism this active misreading of things that Canada has less racism in the U.S that somehow the American exceptionalism that they use to argue we are the beacon on the hill we are the the Apex of liberal democracy and capitalism Canada uses to then argue we are even better than them because we don't have the racist past right um which is just an active denial of of reading history and so races uh denialism is especially strong among dominant social group political leaders and the leaders of police forces and institutions because those institutions are going to reflect social hierarchy that they want to at their premise argue as egalitarian but in practice are absolutely not um and so this is the problem over and over again so I'll just use the example of this of the Canada U.S distinction and I'm going to use it in a way that specifically exemplifies the ways in which kind of whiteness is deployed and hierarchical and doesn't even have to be deployed elsewhere to reflect the differences between account and the U.S so there's an article from 2015 it's not required reading in any way but it just exemplifies how Canada the U.S utilize these Concepts differently um when we think about mental health we think about it in a specific way now but in the past specifically around the turn of the century in the 1900s it was framed in terms of mental hygiene and so like development is Improvement mental health has its history and mental hygiene which is dominant groups deciding which characteristics and behavior are permissible and then institutionalizing in a literal sense those bodies that don't conform to their norms and so this is the professionalization of medical experts and medical experts like education like science like political science is supposed to reflect these Universal valueless truths but in practice they're deployed and they're deployed differently in Canada than the US they reflect different historical cultural institutional contexts they have different understandings of what childhood is about who is responsible but how responsibility happens and so Canada's emphasis is on social reform and America's emphasis is on individual reform so from the out set they have different cultural Traditions Canada us look very similar have very similar paths very similar settlement strategies very similar deployments of race and racism but we are still able to distinguish them differently and this results in all sorts of of differences and so the American emphasis is on professional scientific understanding fixing of the individual and it becomes this issue and this is there is no answer to this question about the idea of mental health as being individual or systemic they are correlated and so at the turn of the century everyone on both sides of the border is reading the same journals and they're both trying to develop the same professional culture but the Americans do it in a very specific way they take medical professionals and say we're doing it scientifically because science and reason is the best thing and the Canadians say no no we're doing this in the interest of Canadians so we're doing it socially we're doing group think and so they focus specifically on immigrant immigrant children from mental hygiene and they only have 30 percent medical profession Nationals whereas the US has 60 percent so the U.S deploys a very specific understanding of Science and expertise and Canada deploys science student expertise in a lesser way that's sublimated to the Canadian political Elite and prominent citizens so in this case Canada's exceptionalism then produces these weird outcomes so America produces in terms of its mental hygiene a focus on the biological foundations of difference because they're doing science right they want to find the thing that proves everything they want to look at a social construct and try to figure out where it comes from biologically as if that's capable as if they can do one without the other and so it looks at at individuals characteristics and it tries to establish a norm which it then opposes on everybody else so it looks at genetic inheritance very much in the American model of this Plantation model about reproduction about bodies about finding the problem in the genetic traditions and the failure to be a good Americans is a genetic defect not a migration defect whereas Canada routinely as a result of this produces this political framing about the ways in which there are the problems of mental health come from the community in which they were imported from that they uh their migration is the problem of their mental health and hygiene that we need to focus on the group the production of Canadian sensibilities Canadian nationalities and those groups that don't conform to that are deviant this was the language because they don't conform to our Norms that we have created publicly using some medical officials but mostly Elites and the dominant groups and so the idea of mental health then is solving public problems that originate not in the anglo-white classes of the higher up and Canadian society and so this idea then is is produced in this kind of absurdity this is an example of this absurdity so this is from the Canadian Journal of mental hygiene in 1920 and so it targets somebody who is a problem and in this case it's an Australian woman and this Australian woman then back to the idea of the categories of race and class is uh categorized in this way because of her actions so she was married two years ago after one week's acquaintance as if that has something to do with her mental health and hygiene that these markers about what puts you in the category are totally arbitrary she has since lived with other men is now pregnant and syphilitic so this is a constant concern is this idea of the reproduction of the group she's pregnant uh I assume I guess out of her marriage with other men um and so for like she hopes for a divorce remember because the state has to mediate whether or not you can get divorced to enable her to marry a much man much older than herself oh my goodness how would the state should be concerned with it the medical community should be concerned with this unless she constantly runs uh unless constantly watched she runs the street with immoral intent this is the foundation upon which we can categorize these people as requiring the resources of the state in order to institutionalize because they are mental hygiene problems and then the diagnosis is there I'm not gonna like these are words that were used as if they were scientific and medical even though they reflected the hierarchy of the group status now we will come back to the ways in which I I you know if you're a liberal you believe that we have progressed I we can just talk about you know all of the problems that we have still to this day in terms of policing bodies and specifically policing bodies around all of these questions and you can argue that they've gone away but I've got lots of evidence maybe I'll skip ahead to just show you this evidence that this is a Perpetual problem that we are still doing to this day that was 2018 and this I took from 2021 and then you can just look up the hashtag birth alerts if you really want to get into the the mess of how these ideas about the role of Canadian institutions policing the bodies about what is the next population are still based in all these coded ways of hierarchy and status that are heavily racialized
 so we'll go through this as as we go but politics in particular has done a pretty poor job of thinking these categories Canadian politics and public policy have largely been absent discussions of these until like 70s 80s right when I when I wrote that chapter with the two friends of mine on teaching race in IR um there's this huge book that came out that had two I think two or three discussions of race in a in how to teach in in international relations two thousand pages and two or three discussions um this happens in a leadership literature right the leadership literature had what was it 5 000 pages and had almost no discussion of gender and Leadership except for women in male leadership not thinking about actual deployments of gender so when we're thinking about these things um you know race is a central organizing concept of European Enlightenment imperialism colonialism enslavement and yet this myth of the absent subject this liberal reading of this experience largely produces the kind of practical construction of of racial hierarchies without it without a thought literally the absence of thought over and over again we get tropes that fill in this noise the idea of manifest destiny of this idea that Americans have a right to the North American continent and the Western Hemisphere that anything that happens within that zone is their domain and if you look at the history of American foreign policy especially in the Western Hemisphere North and South America it has largely been one of intervention over and over and over again Canada has done this as well uh there's I think it's is it angler has a black book a Canadian foreign policy this just talks about the number of times Canada's intervened in Latin America because of the big Banks to to defend bank's interests so this idea of one that this this group on the on the supposed top has the burden of of leadership the idea that we have to civilize everywhere else these ideas about who who is the best kind of and we still have all of these categorizations there I think they're still embedded in how we think about migration and how we rank migration uh in Canada has to do with point system has to do with money and where you come from and your ability to speak the language or all forms in which we dictate which communities should be able to come here um and then of course this idea of the sexualization and the threat or the excessive sexualization of certain communities against uh our sense of morality these Australian migrants who are being too salacious for Canadian hygiene in the 1920s um the Perpetual problem of orientalism which doesn't go away islamophobia in particular is persistent um you could just see it in the discussions of how Canada dealt with Syrian refugees and the idea that we would take only women and children as if somehow Syrian men are because they're men and because they're syrians were a threat and therefore they shouldn't be included that we have this idea that indigenous communities are Vanishing and that we create policies in order to assimilate and Kill The Indian in the child assimilate indigenous communities so we get growing numbers of indigenous communities off Reserve people of indigenous descent off Reserve that we still frame as as disappearing when in fact they're not not even close and so the idea of politics of race science is is really that we we hold on to these Concepts because they seem to have Foundation even though they've been disproven by science over and over again um it still follows and is all over the place in the academy Western universities is highlighted in this text because of the fact that we didn't deny rushton's work until 2020 right like this is no long time ago this is in the present and so this idea of of this is just one I picked to talk about why it's so persistent and how we think about these things people imagine that people have always thought about skin color in this racialized way and we really haven't that idea is no more than a few hundred years old it's not really until the age of colonialism in uh 17th century that you start getting the idea that each continent has its own individual kind of people it arose in a very specific moment in history in the 17th century you're taking long trips by ship and you're struck by how different people look then you remember them when you got on so this is the first edition of Systema nature so the systems of Nature and for man linear distinguishes four varieties these varieties correspond to the four continents where it really changes is in the tenth edition of Systema nature this is the foundation of scientific racism he brings in moral character so the American is red and choleric and stands up straight the European white sanguine and muscular the Asian sallow melancholic and stiff and finally the African black phlegmatic and lazy so these stereotypes have endured Through the Ages if you're going to take a group of people and you're going to decide that they're not people anymore then you need something to justify that you can be defined very differently depending on the country that you're in or the time that you're in and that's how these categories have always been used they are political tools that change depending on their usefulness to whoever is doing the categorization remember Eugenics though is borrowed from the Americans by the not they look to American policies in order to generate some of these things ah I didn't want to do this BBC does more than I would do I don't like the exploiting of bodies for political arguments and so so chauvinistically British that they don't think about the harm of showing images species on the planet humans have far less genetic variation than chimpanzees do and yet those chimpanzees look the same to me there were never any pure races there is no Gene that exists in all the members of One race and not another there is no black Gene there is no white genes human groups overlap completely in their genetic variations in the same way that you're related to your family you can get a kind of fuzzy genetic similarity but when you get to the Continental level which is really where we're talking about race that genetic similarity is so fuzzy and so statistically weak as to be almost meaningless we have this Envy of fields where things are hyper simplistic we want to be able to look at a genome and say that people are these kind of concrete immutable things that cannot be changed genetics doesn't work that way it's the product of many genes interacting with each other and their environments fully answer the question about what a living thing is it's going to be about much more than James if I were to go out onto the street today and find someone of Indian Heritage like myself and randomly then pick someone who is not of Indian Heritage it is perfectly statistically possible for my genome to have more in common with that person who isn't of Indian Heritage than that person who is so that's the point is that the science that underpins this isn't telling us anything about this stuff and yet we still utilize the concepts as if they are scientific right um this idea of what your Europeans as being pure and everybody else is impure and this is what they were talking about the genetic variation within the Human Genome Project is not statistically significant it doesn't mean anything it's not statistically founded in any way um but that doesn't mean we don't do this stuff um that we have the promotion of force sterilization by the Toronto demon medicine uh Charles clerk as I showed in the last video and as I've got here there is ways in which the Canada persistently does this through policies that talk about child welfare back to that original thing the idea of childhood or children as being something that needs to be protected which then justifies the coercion of women into sterilization because we don't want them to have more babies because we fear about the overpopulation of that type of person right um and on top of that we have the eugenicists working in the academy in our Academy that Russians work well it was clear for a long time that he was engaged in this stuff it wasn't formally discredited until 2020 there's the recent retraction of some of those articles but we have these problems these persistent problems and this has been the problem um with the the Kenneth hilborn too around the history program that we have these forms in which racism is embedded in the academy is perpetuated in the academy and because of the denial we don't want to address these issues or we want to say that they're aberrant and that they aren't part of the structural hierarchical Authority that comes from the subject positioning of being experts right and that expertise is something that allows us to speak authoritatively on all matters even on experiences that we don't have and so that's the danger of these institutions and the academies they confer power and authority to make claims that might not have anything to do with the research that you're doing and then even when you combine that research if you don't do it well it becomes shoddy and it becomes these types of claims that are made that don't have any scientific basis but still are made with scientific Authority
 so as I've tried to do throughout and the textbook does as well to think about the ways in which our Concepts our scientific expertise Concepts this kantian or hegelian concepts are um continue to be taught but are often done without their their colonial context or the ways in which those ideas contribute to kind of what's called race thinking or the ways in which hierarchy is embedded in the Norms in which we assume and so you get Concepts like Western Civilization or things like that that are produced or development the idea that that we have a scientific understanding of this thing even though we don't and then we can use that in order to push our understanding as the right one even when that's just based on hierarchy not necessarily some scientific foundation and so that's the the move the decolonizing move is to re-situate these thinkers in their context so that we can understand their ideas as a product of their time and not as universal ideals right not as absent subject positioning and so these ideas are largely used to promote promote white normativity and racial classifications that are interwoven and how we think about these things to justify Empire building we were watching the previous video on on this idea of trying to establish a geographic characteristic for race we we do a similar thing when we talk about geopolitics as if the idea that things happen in a certain place means they must happen that way as if there aren't ways in which politics emerge all over the planet in in many different ways and they don't conform to where they are just because a dominant group is able to run China doesn't mean that there's not a flourishing of different uh groups and attitudes and opinions within China that reflect as many attitudes and opinions as we have here we just don't seek them out and we don't hear them and if we don't hear them we assume they don't exist right and that's the way in which it produces this and so the idea of Empire Building colonialism elimination of indigenous people black enslavement has all been either absent through ignorance or um is produced in such a way that it's framed as in the past right we just basically started doing some of this analysis and so this idea of race thinking of of recognizing the ways in which white settler Society is part of either the identity of all of the experience here is a way to situate thought rather than just produce it uncritically right the idea of uh racial and racist racist typologies are produced and reproduced by the state and universities all the time um and then it's just a question of do we allow like do I think about those subject positions do I think about what I'm doing do I think about what it means for me to easily participate in something and that the ways in which there's higher increasing exclusions embedded in it or just choose not to right just choose my ignorance so choosing ignorance is often easier easier for people in positions of authority and power um the ways in which we have political leaders and public policies that choose ignorance is is this decision to remake our society and our practices um specifically by deploying it as normal as normal and so we've got an example of this in a minute but this is you know the idea that we Herald the the Underground Railroad as kind of Canada's position without thinking of the ways in which we have Jim Crow in the Canadian railroad and the ways in which Asian bodies are are disposably used in order to construct the Canadian national railroad the ways in which residential school system perpetuated education was a key aspect of killing The Indian in the child education was that key because we knew that education was a way to get inside people's minds and make them think against their bodies right and so this pursuit of a white Canada policy large in the 60s I think we can go later than that I mean I think the last residential school closed in 91 right um and so the idea of immigration as being framed in terms of of the stock that we want the exclusion the explicit exclusion of Asians black indigenous peoples from citizenship and voting rights and then we have Stephen Harper this is in 2015. this is the last prime minister talking about this during a debate with Trudeau it's right here let's try and bring it back to the economy yeah well let me just correct the record on a couple things refugees are about the economy David said about refugees first of all the fact of the matter is we did not we have not taken away Health Care from immigrants and refugees on the contrary the only time we've removed it is where we have clearly bogus Refugee claimants who have been refused and turned down we do not offer them a better health care plan than the ordinary Canadian can receive I think that's something and existing and and Old Stock Canadians agree with so I don't know if you caught it there but he said Old Stock Canadians can agree with and so old stock Canadians is versus the new stock Canadians because he sees it as fundamentally different right he frames it as fundamentally different so this is not on Stephen Harper it he you know we he said that you might think that I don't really care I'm not interested in litigating it what I am interested in litigating is the way in which race thinking is part of those discussions it's part of who is an acceptable migrant who who is a valid you hear him say valid Refugee claimant the ways in which we adjudicate whether or not bodies deserve whatever it is they have or whatever it is they can get about you know what could this idea of population what is the Canadian population how should it grow who should be in it right is a constant rethinking about who belongs here and so Vickers and Isaac have a book um which is just the politics of the Canadian state which is states make race and race make States specifically in Canada U.S Australia New Zealand it's specific a part of the policy we have a curtailment on non-white migration largely up to and still in certain ways to the present about who can get in which refugees get in which crises allow those refugees to be claimants and how we prioritize certain communities because they look like us or they act like us or they speak the way we do over other communities that don't right and so that's thinking about how Canadians think of themselves Who belongs and who should belong and so there there's stories and discourses that are hidden from political science because we like to think of the abstract and not the specific and so we have a bunch of different ways in which political science is engaged in these ways of thinking um this idea of the two founding races framework which is just this notion of that we have an English and French tradition that we just obliterate the other experiences and traditions that come along with it that we have this race and ethnicity discussion the conflation of these two things so that we don't have to think race and then which obviously results in denial so that this idea the race question goes back to this two race theory of Canada um it's persistent it's why we still have bilingualism and not trilingualism it's this notion that these two founding Frameworks serve as the the idea of Canadian culture that those two languages allow anyone to participate in dominant Canadian culture and so I don't know I I think it's my um daughter is is taking French right now um in grade nine and I don't know um Grade 9 French I I'm not going to say it's bad I'm just going to say why don't we have if we're doing all this reconciliation if we are doing this reconciliation if we're doing land acknowledgments we're doing all the rest of that why don't we have to you know learn the language upon which we we s we settle you think that that would be there that's the premise of French and English is that we're settled and if you want to settle you should speak one of those languages in dominant discourse in public but the idea then is that why aren't we doing the next step right and so this two founding races is a a productive myth because it it produces the idea that white European settlement is the valid Foundation of political agency and Authority it's what makes up the the Canadian State the nation state it's the Erasure the active Erasure the ongoing Erasure you tell me what the Canada flag is the ongoing Erasure of indigenous Traditions produced in some absent white ignorant ahistorical framing of how this functions everybody else is the other they're the two dominant groups so why don't we just do that right there's ways in which everything else is subordinated in these other uh categories this racial logic is incorporated into Political Science journals academic writing and so race and ethnicity then is used interchangeably as if did the same thing and indigeneity is largely absent from both it is you often subsumed under race but remember indigeneity predates these categories and it is in terms of the idea the boundary between the civilized and the uncivilized um the migration the settlement of Canada is using migration as a strategy of settlement so as a strategy of settlement then it is using certain type of raced bodies as a way for which we settle Canada so what Canada is and so everybody else is then framed as other and then these racialized discourses are framed as sources of threat so Canada it just erases we have we had a literal head tax on Chinese immigrants we would charge them money um in order to migrate they still would migrate and then we would um force them into very specific professions or jobs and then deny their full rights and citizenship and so the the all of this is framed in terms of of how we think about those things and this hasn't changed I would like to say it's changed a little bit but there was a big um article in The Gazette I want to say a couple years ago about how a researcher on campus was taking money from Huawei as if Huawei was the source of all sorts of problems because it didn't geopolitically fit how we think about Canada and the US's position in relationship to the rest of the world and so taking this money from a Chinese company was seen as a problem on the our campus our campus is the site of these problems um and that we perpetuate these right we perpetuate them especially if we're producing those liberal ethos of something like humanitarianism about the problems out there in the world and how we should solve them this has been in the past through Community Service Learning I'll start alternative spring break things like that about where the problem is that needs to be fixed as out there rather than here and so it frames that otherness right there um we also have this idea that race is is interchangeable with ethnicity and then slowly replaced by it we still produce this over and over again we don't have racism in the Canadian Journal of political science which of Western's political science program just finished editing this journal uh last year in the last couple years um and so it's not even in there until 74. and so this isn't new this is old and this is persistent um this was from Fortune Magazine but this is the idea that even in 1938 with everything that's going on with the Nazis um the attitudes in the U.S was still we should try to keep them out um as they are we should try to keep those uh fleeing political Refugee from German and Austria and this is doubled when you look at the anti-Semitism I couldn't find it I actually have it somewhere I just couldn't find it in my notes of the ways in which the attitudes towards specifically Jews fleeing what was going on in Europe um was not seen as something that we would want to take and so the framing is everything the ways in which we frame these issues as if we think that these issues are over this is a classic kind of liberal framing um one that yes these are very contemporary issues but two oh the problem was in the past it was red it got bad in segregation and it was good now um but we can just change that if we do it like this it's red and then a little less red and then a little yellow in mass incarceration I couldn't find anything for Canada I couldn't find any of those for Canada I looked them up over and over again and we don't have any simple timelines for Canada's settlement as a strategy I was going to do it and then I thought I'm just going to step in a can of worms I do think it should be done I just didn't have time to do it today um but this is what I could find this is statscan um uh most of the stats that statscan was giving me were moving in the opposite direction this one is going upwards so the idea of progress the liberal notion of progress isn't necessarily supported by the evidence I'll get into it in the next um week's lecture but for example in the last 10 years the undp report came out today that the world is moving backwards in terms of women's rights so this idea of a natural progress or moving beyond these things isn't really supported by the data it's only supported by belief right this I just pulled this from uh the link is there from the Globe and Mail um just dealing I I don't even have time to get into some of this stuff relating to prisons and the prison industrial complex in the US and Canada but just the idea of the over-representation of indigenous and black populations in Canadian prisons speaks to versus the percentage of the population speaks to these ways in which we are still perpetuating these problems and so the the third move the kind of standard move and the move that is the most easy for those in positions of authority and hierarchies to Simply say I'm not going to talk about this or I don't want to talk about this or it's something that's not relevant to what I'm doing uh it's it's ignorance as active denial as the inability to find these issues in the everyday um and so we have all of these questions about we try to reduce them to sociological ones like like I've talked about in the past um the idea that that this is something we can study but not something we perpetuate um we have all of the ways in which it was 97 it wasn't even 91 it was 97. um all of these ways in which they re-emerged and so racial thinking doesn't go away it just takes different forms and we have different debates and the ways in which these these have come up again like I didn't think we'd be doing the Nazi stuff again but here we are we're fighting about fascism and Nazis again um and so this idea of of you know fighting Nazis in in Europe well racism is perpetuated in these states is these weird I mean I've got so many tick tocks on this and the appendix um about the ways in which this is perpetuated the idea of the UN as the Bastion of the liberal absence subject progressing towards human freedom maybe stands we have these statements over and over again but we still have the existence of apartheid we have the existence of all forms of these these laws being passed of gerrymandering of all sorts of ways in which this isn't necessarily we're moving away from and so this idea of combating racism then has a very short history so it's if we're going to do the little graph it would be a very short period that the charter has a key part of the human rights is a key part of it the Bill of Rights in 1960 but that the charter is so relatively recent that when we're thinking about the coloniality and racial classifications there's still very much part of the everyday the idea of race and racelessness race denial not thinking about subject location because you happen to be in hierarchical positions of authority western western um producing this over and over again and that political science has a key role to to play in both perpetuating and challenging this thinking I'm hoping we're doing a bit of challenging I'm not very convinced about that um because so much of what we're doing is still based in these hierarchical structures um the white supremacy has kind of bound up in how we think about these and that we are just like the very beginnings of of rethinking some of these Concepts and we're already getting all sorts of blow back right and so this idea we we have to welcome this racial Reckoning that we have to do this work there's no reason we can't be doing this work it's just some people choose not to do it and so we're thinking about those things we have to think about the ways in which we are participating in forms of of normativity right racial normativity or we're challenging racial normativity it's one or the other the oppressors in all of us you have to decide what you're going to do um with that
 so this is the video from the um how do you define from the textbook um again they just took it from crash course but I'm not going to show the whole thing I'll just show a bit of it um which covers the same material as before again the absent subject position probably should be foregrounded a bit more clearly the race if you had to describe why you think you're a member of One race and someone else was a member of a different one you'd probably focus on appearances your skin your hair maybe even the structures of your bodies and faces but most of the time those physical criteria mean different things depending on the culture you're a part of an obvious example is skin color we use the word white and black to describe two races but the distinction in skin color between those races isn't as clear-cut a white person listen white people aren't white like look at me on some shade of pink and you know there's this if you there's been lots of art installations that have shown that like it's some type of beige and there's melanin differences and they change throughout your life and lighting matters and I just changed my lighting source and now it looks differently so again you can try to do this but I I think it's slippery then who spent the summer at the beach might come home with brown skin but getting a tan doesn't change their race and light-skinned black people may have skin that's not all that darker than that tan clearly race is about more than just the literal color of someone's skin so let's talk about race and why it's a topic that goes more than Skin Deep [Music] much like gender race is a socially constructed category in this case it's used to categorize people who share biological traits that a society thinks are important so you might be wondering wait what oh man Americans have messed up views on Race I'm worried it's sociologically too they don't do the politics properly I'm not sure about this I'll let it continue but I'm not sure how can race be both a social construct and something based on biology well the key part part of that definition of race is the last part what a society thinks is important sure skin color varies widely across regions of the world but so does eye color and we don't consider people with blue eyes A different race than people with brown eyes and while physical traits are often used to describe or identify a race they're not always applied consistently take for example the so-called one drop rule in the United States where even the smallest amount of African-American ancestry is enough to classify someone as black rather than white the opposite however isn't true someone with one black parent and one white parent is almost never considered white plus people from different places or different time periods have defined racial groups differently nowadays light-skinned people of European descent are typically considered white in the United States it doesn't matter whether your heritage is British or Irish or Italian or polish or German you're just white but that wasn't the case a century ago in the early 1900s anyone who wasn't white Anglo-Saxon Protestant was considered ethnic so for example if you were Italian or Irish you weren't considered white likewise today being Jewish is often the Protestant part right the Catholic part um it's still you know this long history with um like she said the Irish and the Italians but also like Jewish and all the rest of it so again it's so slippery seen as an ethnicity in the United States but Europeans are more likely to think of being Jewish As a Race So that raises the question what's the difference between ethnicity and race well ethnicities are socially constructed categories based on cultural traits that a society finds important rather than strictly biological traits essentially an ethnic group is a group that has a shared cultural heritage language Traditions religion these are all types but does it go in reverse does any group that shares a cultural heritage become an ethnic group this is what I mean these categories are so like furries they have a culture that they share do we consider them an ethnic group like I I sociology likes categorizing which is why I'm a bit more hesitant to use it than at least the evidence-based well I mean anthropology is sociology one is interested in exploring culture one is interesting classifying culture I would say I don't know whatever it's a culture that can determine your ethnic background two people of different races might share an ethnicity and conversely to people of the same race might be of totally different ethnicities Japanese and Vietnamese people are both considered Asian but they come from different cultural backgrounds in fact a term that many people think refers to race Hispanic actually refers to ethnicity to explore this a little more let's go to the thought bubble to talk about the difference between the terms Hispanic Latino and Latin American the term do we ossify these categories do we reinforce them by so wanting to nail them down as if they mean one thing I just I wonder about the monovocality of this like speaking with a single voice right versus multiple voices anyways Hispanic first appeared as a racial category in the U.S census in 1970 as a way of describing those whose Heritage originated in a Spanish-speaking country before then the census referred to those people as Spanish Americans even though tracing back their Origins to Spain would mean going away way back for many of them and for others it'd be totally inaccurate but in day-to-day conversation most people from Spanish-speaking backgrounds were usually referred to by the country of their Heritage like Mexican-American or Cuban American or sometimes more broadly as Latin American this lasts well because there's a big difference between Mexico and Cuba right like even within those communities they have different dialects different Expressions different ways of of articulating and seeing things one form of speaking isn't the same is another I don't know like this seems like it's from the top down I I don't I don't know the value of this let's get it this term is also where we get the word Latino and the degendered latinx it's a shorter version of the Spanish word Latino Americano and it refers to someone whose Heritage originates from nations in the Americas that are south of the United States including Mexico all of South America and the Caribbean now not all think about these definitions of what they're doing in terms of understanding like I don't have any source for that I don't know where it comes from and I know that these are contested all over the place but like we want one I guess so we feel that we have a good understanding of those communities and if we understand those communities we can speak authoritatively about them I don't know this is I mean everything rubs me the wrong way but this is really really wrong Hispanics are Latino being from Spain for example makes you Hispanic but not Latino and not all Latinos are Hispanic Brazilians speak Portuguese meaning that they are not considered Hispanic but regardless of which term you're using Hispanic or Latino either of these distinctions are based on physical appearance unlike race which is based on observable physical traits ethnicities aren't and in fact okay and I don't know that that's two people of the same ethnicity can be entirely different races for example both Cameron Diaz and Rosario Dawson are Cuban Americans which means they are both Hispanic but Cameron Diaz is white and Rosario Dawson is black thanks thought bubble though race is more commonly used by society as a way to organize people and distribute power both race and ethnicity play a role in how people are perceived and therefore the opportunities that are available to them a person's race influences a whole host of social outcomes from their education to their income to their experiences with the criminal justice system but which races or ethnicities are advantaged or disadvantaged depends on when and where we're talking about for example in the United Kingdom so are they not including whiteness in this discussion then I mean I'm okay with with framing it as a as a non-existent phenotypical characteristic or whatever characteristic that you want to frame it as but I feel like it's an absent subject position again I I don't know there's been a lot of unrest about immigration from Eastern Europe especially Poland dility and violence against polish immigrants increased in the wake of the UK's exit from the European Union but while Eastern Europeans are considered an ethnic minority in the UK people in the U.S are much more likely to think of Eastern European immigrants as just white they're not thought of as a minority and that's because what constitutes a minority is more complex than you might think sociologists Define a minority as any category of people who are distinguished by physical or cultural differences isn't that just defined like I don't understand Society sets apart and subordinates this is the danger of doing interdisciplinary work is that the assumptions of one discipline come from a specific set of experiences but in political side we don't like definitions we don't like definitions because we think everything is contested so it doesn't make sense to just like throw around definitions like this now notice that does that share a distinctive identity based on physical or cultural traits second minorities occupy a lower status in society and have less access to the levers of societal power notice how that definition doesn't say anything about the size of the group in sociology a minority group's relative size isn't important for example women are considered a minority even though they make up about 51 percent of the United States and a group that's a minority in terms of size can still be a majority in terms of power South African apartheid is an example of this from 1948 to 1994. Pixar's Africa apartheid okay skirt skirt the politics or a white minority maintained a system of racial segregation and discrimination against black South Africans right now non-hispanic whites are the majority group in the United States in terms of sheer size making up 61 percent of the US population but that's I don't like the way she said weights I tend to not use it I tend to use it as a category put upon people but I don't like appropriating it rapidly changing as of 2015 babies of color being born now outnumber non-hispanic white babies and five states are already minority majority States California Texas New Mexico Nevada and Hawaii how can a state or country be minority majority isn't that like an oxymoron well for one thing even if non-hispanic white Americans no longer make up more than half of the country they'll likely remain a larger group than any other single race but also to be a minority in the sociological sense of the word a group must be in a position of disadvantage and as we've discussed many times before non-hispanic white Americans tend to have higher incomes live in better neighborhoods and are more likely to have more prestigious jobs and better educations than racial and ethnic minorities but before we can make comparisons between different racial groups in the U.S we should talk about the races I just don't understand the relationship between this correlation and politics right so we know the case that the Harper conservatives did a really good job of politicizing relatively conservative groups throughout the GTA that supported the conservative party we know that that the the Cuban population in Florida has been going very far right lately and supported Trump and in part the Hispanic population voting for Trump is what turned I think that state and it was in New Mexico for Trump as well so I don't know what we're doing in terms of a politics this is sociology it's not the same make up the United States the U.S census uses six different categories of race when collecting data oh great just great well like what is a census but uh just a categorization machine anyways about the demographics of the country white refers to anyone who reports their Origins as being from Europe the Middle East or Northern Africa so Irish the Middle East okay German Italian Lebanese Iranian Moroccan they're all ethnicities that go under the heading of white so Persian Falls okay yes you heard me right people of Middle Eastern descent are categorized as white by the census even if they often aren't treated as if they're white why well what's now become known as white originates from a term to refer to people of Indo-European descent the Caucasian race the term Caucasian started as a reference to the caucus mountains which run through the modern day countries of Russia Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan I can't help but feel like American racial politics shouldn't be teaching us anything that this just is so weird this is a bunch of Supreme Court Justices the race was understood as a purely biological phenomenon everyone from Europe all the way down to India was lumped into one Caucasian group so yesterday's Caucasian contained most of the people who count as today's white but also captured groups that nowadays get labeled you see the danger of doing this mono vocally I showed that video already earlier in the course about the the kind to the dangerous racist history of Caucasian and it's just being deployed here kind of uncritically I'm not happy with this video Asians such as Indians or pakistanis now many Hispanic Americans are also all suspanic is considered an ethnicity not a race for census purposes so in the 2010 census 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified so a census is for governmentality right it's for us to govern and it allows us to categorize what we consider important and picks the data that we want to do over we we need it to to do policy in order to show policy impact and outcomes which is why it was so dangerous when Canada lost the the census for a couple years because our data no longer is complete but we don't have to treat it uncritically provide themselves as white while 36.7 percent identified themselves as some other race and smaller percentages identified themselves as one of the other racial groups black or African Americans or the SEC I think the number four religion in the UK is Jedi because people can enter it on the census okay hit largest racial group in the United States and are defined as individuals with African Heritage including those who are afro-caribbean since many African-Americans ancestors were forcibly brought to the United States as slaves the countries that their ancestors originated from are often unknown to this day the remnants of slavery and the southern plantation systems can be seen in the geographic distribution of black Americans around the country though many black Americans moved to Northern cities during the Great Migration of the early 20th century most remained in the south in a region that has come to be known as the black belt of the United States the third racial category used in the census is American Indian or Alaska native which refers to anyone whose Origins are indigenous to the contiguous United States and Alaska though Native Americans numbered in the millions when Europeans first arrived in the 15th century today they control only two percent of the country's land area make up just 0.2 percent of the US population and remains severely disadvantaged in terms of access to education and income the fourth census category for race Asian refers to origins in eastern Asia southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent including China India Japan Pakistan the Philippines and Vietnam the largest subgroup of Asian Americans are those so like the whole world okay it was a Chinese ancestry who make up a little less than one-fourth of the total Asian American population the fifth census category is native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander which refers to people whose Origins are from Hawaii Guam Samoa or other Pacific Islands as I mentioned before Hawaii is one of the states where a minority race is the majority race for the state and in fact it's the only state that has always been minority majority the last census category is just to catch all some other race you might remember that about a third of Hispanic Americans fall into this group if a person lists a country of origin that doesn't fit in one of the other categories they get stuck in this group you might be thinking that these categories don't seem like the racial groups you typically think of and that's okay they also don't seem to make any sense and reflect the ways in which power doesn't make any sense and it's deployed in strategically over space and time hey in all likelihood the way that the government defines remember because like Puerto Ricans don't have representation either does anybody in Guam like what are we doing here there's all sorts of colonial relationships here that we're just glossing over I mean Washington DC is still doesn't have full statehood right like it says we'll continue to change to incorporate our society's changing Notions of race and ethnicity and something that should be clear from everything we talked about today is that races aren't fixed immutable categories they are defined by societies today we learned that but should we challenge them I have no sense of the politics here we just go about race as if it's socially constructed but we're not involved in its construction in these videos that I literally showed in class that are constructing Notions of what you think are a race the difference between races and ethnicities we discussed how definitions of races and ethnicities have changed over time and across places we also discussed the terms minority and minority majority and we finished that by discussing how races are defined in the United States should we use the us as a template here I feel like it's a bad idea anyways there's these in here I'm sure we'll talk about the stuff in class and these are the concepts I went over everything what cultural racism because I don't I mean we can go into it but I I wouldn't include that because I don't think it's a useful way to do systemic makes sense racialization race institutional racism imperialism ethnicity maybe but I think they're all contested Concepts
