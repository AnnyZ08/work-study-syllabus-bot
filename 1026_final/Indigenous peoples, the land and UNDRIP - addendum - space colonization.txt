 so this is an addendum I'm not even sure I'm gonna put it I might put it in the playlist but I might hide it from the video I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet um this comes out of in the international relations Capstone last term um we were looking at a bunch of students you know the billionaires were all doing the Space Race so we were talking about space and the likelihood of space colonization and my you know ears pricked up when I heard the word colonization I'm like I wonder to what extent this is actually settler colonialism is our future as well so it's not just the past it is the future and when I looked I was shocked and horrified about how it was actually more of the future than I could have even conceived of now I don't want to punch down a teenager um but he summarizes the issues well that specifically come from this and we have the UN Industrial Development organization talking about how space exploration will save the environment it's largely been framed in terms of extractivism this has you know a couple thousand views and this is a bit old but this summarizes quite aptly how we frame these issues and how misguided we are going to replicate the same patterns over and over again I don't think we've learned anything I don't have any evidence that we are actually doing any more thought on this than we have from 1648. 1492. so this is I mean there is a there you know a benefit in the ignorance of the young right and that it is they can clearly explain issues as they've learned it from us and that they have the best of intentions and I am in no way criticizing his intentions or his his um I think this is very audible admirable leadership that's that's what I'll say about that how do we catalyze a change in the way our society buys sells produces manufactures well this question is fundamental to making our civilization more sustainable and our civilization more sustainable answering it we usually turn to economists and this man no no we don't we don't turn to economists because they call everything negative externalities the ideal of functioning of an efficient market with Sublime demand which um amalgamates all the available information to make the most efficient decisions and outcomes does not have a theory of the negative externalities of the ecological costs of growth it makes sense but I'm a science-focused high school student and a highly qualified non-economist and I find the technological aspect to be extremely interesting because so this is ecological techno fetishism which is just the idea that if we put more and more resources behind technology they will result in more efficient outcomes the graph I showed earlier of um the the use of energy consumption is what's called jevin's paradox jevin's paradox is that as Things become more energy efficient we feel that it's not as costly to use them hence we use more of it so there is no indication that we are decreasing in any way our energy consumption through the use of new technologies what we are seeing is that we're using more of it more efficiently so I guess that's good I can actually correlate I have done this before I can you can correlate the history of Western economic growth in terms of GDP to the Discovery and deficiency of new forms of energy it's weird because as it turns out Humanity's first fully sustainable Society won't actually be here on Earth it'll be on Mars I developed an interest in space a place that doesn't have a clear source of energy or of water I'm not sure how that would be sustainable it's at a young age and I think one of the most important parts of space exploration boils down to one really convenient thought self-sustainability you see conducting a mission Beyond who is self is this no man is an island is this an individual is this a situated social context is this an absence of context in history is Mars functioning as the imaginary Blank Slate upon which we can imagine a new world that will be efficient because we can engineer it to to be so I will show you how that's not the case in like two minutes I don't even know he doesn't Okay um this is the cosmology modernity it came out in 78. nature is a virtually Limitless Storehouse of resources for human use Humanity has the commission to use and control nature nature is malleable and can be reconfigured for human ends Humanity has the right perhaps even the calling to use Nature's resource for an improvement of its material standard of living sure listen you know this is the idea that life is a fight against entropy like energy is always moving energy is always being lost we're trying to preserve more of it to extend our lives sure quality of life is further by economic system to direct it to ever expanding material abundance okay but physics says that we're on a ball and that ball all has a limited energy amount of energy or we've got to tap all the energy coming from the big fiery ball that's giving us all of our energy the future is open systemic material for the whole human race again we've got race and we've got human bound up in there and through the careful use of human powers and Humanity can make history turn out right sure um there's so many loaded questions the things we create are under our control the good life is one of productive labor and material well-being the successful person is one who achieves it on their own successful progress and interests are served by achievement oriented behavior work ethic is essential to human being there's freedom and material abundance when people have more their freedom of choices expanded and will ever be more uh uh so we could frame this a bit differently the Earth is sacred and we are sacrilegious we are uh part of a world that we are actively destroying and now seeking to extract resources from another world because we've limited this one climate change is then framed as a lived experience and not a preventable one we don't because of that all of those assumptions lead to all of these things Humanity seems to be this is the concept of the anthropocene we'll talk about later in the course the most single destructive force in nature we have changed the course of nature in part because we don't think we are part of nature because of all the assumptions and that climate volatility is and uncertainty is the norm and so part of the way that we overcome that is to create a new blank slate and a new place where we can extract new resources and a new sustainable future so what I did with this exercise with the class is that we just picked two things one of these I picked from 2021 so not long ago thinking about these questions the underlying assumptions a lot of this stuff goes back to which has been criticized a bit but doesn't have a lot to say NASA was a little more critical of this idea that Innovation is the foundation of space exploration um so what have Americans done they have largely privatized their space exploration because they want to unleash the power of free interest Enterprise to lease a United Humanity permanently into the solar system sure um this is largely reproducing the frontier rhetoric of settlement of North America the frontier is a archetype that is used in masculinity in particular it was used by dieffenbaker it was also used by JFK as the idea that we are moving forward that progress comes from us pushing into train where we previously were not before the frontier needs to be explored dominated extracted and and taken for our benefit at the expense of it it is just nature and it is the dominant metaphor in space exploration it is still in the the stuff that comes all over the place Stephen Hawking Elon all of them talk about this about how space exploration will happen okay space Advocates have based their stuff on a very specific understanding of the past that has no recognition of the ways in which energy sources have gone in to facilitate and their ever increasing use of the excuse me processes of settlement and expansion it reinforces and reinterprets myths beliefs and archetypes into the originating civilization narrative right the idea of knowing of creating commercial empires of outmaneuvering political economic and religious competitors it makes War diplomacy proselytizing scholarship and trade by other means so we get a lot of these metaphors about Wilderness the American frontier American Manifest Destiny that they have an obligation and that let's be clear the majority white OB has an obligation to to these places it is Theirs to dominate dominate This Mother Earth patriarchy oppression sexism all those stuff built into that Wilderness is a place that is there to be dominated and tamed by science and reason versus nature and those bodies that are there do not count as bodies and so we've got this framework of Astro environmentalism that somehow going over there will prevent the problems that we've done here so we can do this in terms of the first space colony and we see how immediately this whole thing falls apart okay great if you get a crew of ten you can send them to Mars and you will basically have to deal with governance structures relating to their individual psychology and their legitimacy and it's likely prone to collapse it can't reproduce itself 10 is not enough to create a viable civilization okay so now we need a community so let's do a hundred let's ship a hundred to Mars the members can compete better over positions they can compare expertise they can have a shared sense of legitimacy their governments will be Mission commanders unrest can be lowered by elections it's a hundred it's easy to do elections bring broader legitimacy to the government system and um but they still don't stop the uh the idea of having single elected persons dominating everyone else elections will not solve the problems of deliberation needed by various experts okay so let's send a society of a thousand so a thousand can better reproduce um they will develop their values and normative behaviors um they will have branches of government that are are allowed them to be questioned they will develop local Dynamics their independence will give them senses and sources of power their experts will have uh higher degrees of respect their politicization of expertise is going to be inevitable there will be distinctions between practicality and scientists expertise versus democracy and deliberation will happen so okay even if we do those things we have all these questions of governance of Science and Engineers that we send to do this Libertarians believe that governments aren't willing to do these things and therefore it shouldn't be based on governments it should be based on technical expertise exceptionists believe that we have to do this in order to benefit us and commuterians say that they are going to build a better future because they're going to start with commuterine starting points this is settler colonialism all over again the easiest way we can do this is you are creating new Society what's the racial composition who gets to be where how many people get to be there how do his race still exist does race not exist if race doesn't exist you've got forms of culture and hierarchy that are already there how are you going to deal with those who's going to pick those what is it going to look like is this just a new form of white supremacy elsewhere is it going to democratically represent the place we have here there and the weird part is is that things like scientists aren't necessarily useful so we don't actually want a thinking crew when we go abroad we want those who are able to build things and do things the Social Development of ideas is largely done on Earth and on Mars they need people to implement those forms of Frameworks we are still going to have to have a deep connection between the scientists who at scale have to develop things using massive amounts of resources to come up with those innovations that are implemented on Mars so there's going to be a deep connection between the place where we start from and the place where we end up the civilization we create now on top of that the problem that happens immediately is that the instant people sit in a new Terror territory and we know this from the Boston Tea Party the American Revolution the French Revolution the Haitian revolution once people get a degree of autonomy from the place in which they have come they're going to start to identify themselves differently they will be martians we are back to politics so we have to deal with the idea of how stable is the system going to be who is going to have authority these questions of expertise of science are going to come from Earth versus here we're going to want to develop Martian science as distinct from the Reliance on earth science and that Martian science is going to want to expand and get more and more resources so we're going to have these questions about who is in charge what's the foundation of their Authority is their Foundation of authority that they come from Earth what is that going to mean for the generation after them who see themselves as truly Martian how does that Martian identity deal with the Earth identity how are they related to each other who has sense of authority what's the foundation of authority what's the social contract that binds them and do Martians have more legitimate authority over Mars than the earth people do over Mars how do these come together how are these bound together we have all of these questions what kind of security are we going to have what do we do when someone breaks the law what's the basis of Law and Authority are we going to establish the based on the law of authority from Earth or from their new system are we going to draw Traditions whose Traditions are going to draw from are we going to draw from indigenous Traditions are we going to draw from uh White Traditions that we draw from African Traditions how are we going to do this how are we going to establish political security what kind of sustainability are we talking about here whose resources are going together how are we going to allocate those resources are we going to allocate them racially are we going to put them in a form of Communism are we going to have free enterprise dominating things in which case we're going to have massive inequalities of resources on a new space how is this going to flourish what is the flourishment going to look like and then we have the questions technology cannot be developed without politics we need to know how to do this that what's going to happen immediately is how are we going to restrain prison guards in space prisons from exerting psychological pressure on the prisoners of we're going to open the airlock we're going to constantly torture and threaten people with the opening the airlock because it's such an easy way to deprive them of life and so the construction of this Authority on Mars immediately looks either authoritarian fascist or some form a militarism whereby those in positions of authority over those who are imprisoned would have to establish a very strong basis of Rights by which they can't do things except we have no idea what the foundation of that Authority comes from is it God is it the queen is it Martian is it Earth how do we establish those questions what do they look like how do they function if the mission is driven by liberal Society it's going to spread liberal values how does resistance to those liberal values look like we have resistance today when a liberal government implements covid restrictions or lockdowns if the Martians want to be independent and exceptional to Earth it will not lead to a stable and sustainable policy of human flourishing so what we're going to get then is exactly what we have right now which is this idea that we can create a fantasy on this place we don't think about the relationships or the Dynamics the politics of it we just envisioned this Ideal World and that we spend all our time fighting with the fact that this Ideal World never actually functions like that this break this radicalism this rationality that's supposed to underpin this system is based largely on a Cosmopolitan narrative that says that no one will fall back into their old traditional ways nationalist temporary will go away democracy is the true political system as if we don't have these ideas of these civilizations fighting against these these colonization these planetary issues aren't going to reproduce the same problems that we had in the past we have to go abroad we have to make better all cultures and traditions interpenetrate interconnected inter mingle cosmopolitism without provincialism is empty proventilism without Cosmopolitan is is blind the contribution of that colony to humanity will raise ethical economic and legal principles rationalizing the colonies existence that we will have to reckon with and the continuous debate over which public goods should be delivered what's the appropriate level of taxes what's the rule of the free market what's the Socialist who is benefit are we talking about Mankind or Martian kind well inevitably reduce all the problems over and over again it's going to be a grave source of instability throughout the solar system and it cannot be governed properly from the beginning so good luck with that mic drop
