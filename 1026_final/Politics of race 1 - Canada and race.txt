 okay uh Welcome to our discussion of the politics of race um I'm not going to be able to I mean every field is dealing with their own framings of race in their own particular ways um this chapter I'm going to supplement like many of the others it's very abstract because it doesn't want to get caught in the weeds though it goes specific in some weird sections as well um these this I mean as I've as we talked in the previous lectures like a lot of these relationships the settlement of North America is linked to um this triangle trade the trade of goods the The Furs in particular beaver pelts going back to England which was then traded over to Africa which then brought bodies um for the slave trade to the Caribbean and to North America and so this integral patterns of trade still tends to follow those routes to the this day now um yeah my subject positioning I think we should all be conscious of our subject positioning who we are where we're from um what our attitudes are and and how they impact how we think about things because that's what we're doing this week we're taking some of those liberal Concepts and ideas that we discussed previously and situating them in context right so um I've written on Race a couple times engaging with the concepts thinking about my own subject positioning how that functions how we think about these how we teach and how we learn about this and whether or not we're capable of learning we have to be open to learning we have to recognize a couple different things so I've written recently about it in the context of covid but also in the context of teaching about race is that particularly those with privilege should absolutely be spending their time and resources thinking about these things because that privilege comes from this exact kinds of hierarchy right um and so what I say when I'm saying subject positioning all that I'm saying is is that we have to not assume an absent subject or this kind of idealized universal subject of the liberal political framing the one that is the autonomous individual who mixes their labor with land in order to create property but to recognize no that I had parents or I have people who raised me I have those who care for me those who contribute to my well-being and contribute to my mental health and that they are implicated in my success or failures in the positive and negative and so my subject positioning is always going to be implicated in those and that's also to return to this idea from shilliam we have the suppressor in all of us right that we reflect majoritarian sensibilities in our social facticity or the ways in which we just do the ways in which we are I can't undo those ways in which those privileges reflected through me but I should be conscious and develop everybody should have those tools to to challenge us so my ability to enter a washroom unchallenged is is a clear sense of privilege and that's going to reflect a normativity inherent in my subject in in who I am and how I do things um my ability to resolve issues or the ability to resolve issues by calling the police is a clear part of the settler and of the white settler majoritarian sensibility the idea of not to be challenged or treated as suspicious in certain contexts or Frameworks is all linked into that and so I'm not going to tell other people about their subject positioning or experiences what I'm going to do is try to bring in as much as I can the ways in which I can amplify those voice choices and this is a practice this is his thing and we're always going to mess up at it I'm going to have to try better and do better all the time this kind of practices of amplifying voices deferring voices and citing those voices that can speak more eloquently or better or from a position of experience that I don't have because of my own subject position so when we're talking about the learning objectives for this chapter we're really trying to delve into what has largely been an unexamined concept which is that of Canadian conceptualizations of race the ways in which race is deployed or racialization is deployed and then how those are embedded in structures attitudes and institutions and forms of racism we are going to challenge this object this absent subject this absent Canadian subject that has a raceless colorblind race neutral attitude we're going to link those to Scientific racism colonialism imperialism and our own Academy and Western itself we have these legacies they're ongoing their practices that continue they're not in the past these are never in the press and so white cellular societies are constantly remaking these categories of normativity when I am able to do things are not able to do things I'm remaking those categories so we have to be critical of that we have to think of the ways in which they're embedded in in kind of discussion legislation and what we're trying to do in political science remember if we're if we're teaching those who are in power we are teaching forms of hierarchy which also means we're teaching forms of marginalization and often oppression and so we can highlight these racialized discourses and then we can talk a bit about the emergence in the 2020 I don't know why that would matter I guess it's just because of the mobilization around it but mobilization around an issue shouldn't be why we address the issue it should be because the issue is there and is important and so I've added in some Concepts throughout um this week to give a little more context um and and to frame these and to link into our next two weeks discussion so that of the what I've been arguing the other absent subject is is the gendered and sexed subjects um they're just totally absent here um as well as forms of intersectionality um tend to be we've weirdly compartmentalized bodies and so I've got a tick tock that talks about that as well it tries to oversimplify it so um I I do want to talk about I think there are elements that have to be understood as Canadian senses of race and racism and the ways in which Canada in particular using multiculturalism has used that as an impediment to think about racial hierarchy and racial Construction in the way in which race is deployed um and that you know this these questions of race disrupt the kind of politics of as usual and let's do it like absolutely so I don't know more Truth and Reconciliation black lives matter but also we've got anti-asian racism in the context of covid we've got islamophobia and anti-Semitism and then the the kinds of normative oppression that come for intersectional bodies we won't talk about it as much this week but next week we'll definitely get a two-spirit non-binary lgbtqi those ways in which these things and that's why I'm a little hesitant to take them apart because when we put them all together that intersectionality results in overlapping forms of discrimination and oppression that I perpetuate when I speak and do things and have the capacity to do so and it is Amplified especially for let's say um intersectional bodies or non-binary bodies in the context of you know gender norms and then of racial Norms as well and so that's going to be a problem now the key thing to think this isn't in the textbook but this is a key way to think about this W.E DuBois this is written in 1935. um this is Political Science this is as canonical to political science as could be and it's largely been whitewashed literally eliminated from our teaching for the last Almost hundred years so this existed this is there's lots of this it's been around and one of the Frameworks that comes out of this is that the deployment of remember the the concept of of race as a form of categorization doesn't emerge until the 1600s or so and when it does emerge it has to be deployed politically so it takes time and takes different ways and which is done and so what Dubois is talking about is this theory of race is that as it's a slowly evolved mechanism of kind of social factitity of the ways in which like ideas get concretized in brains and then police bodies and then say what is permissible and not right swimming pool politics in the states um the ways in which this is has happened over time and so what he his Insight was from the the 30s in particular was looking at kind of sociologically looking at the experiences of those bodies in the U.S particularly in the U.S South that have by all kind of marxist definitions or class definitions no clear demarcation between them they are both poor um they have about the same political agency they're largely in the same conditions they have the same level of Education same attitudes all the rest all the rest of that and we'll come back to this as we go but as I've already talked about this last week about the idea of Christians how do we distinguish between types of Christians when the former slaves and the white workers are both Christians and so what he says is they have practically identical interests um that there's there's nothing that sees either a part and so what happens then is that the white group of laborers they receive a low wage as well but they're compensated in a form of public and psychological wage they're given public deference and titles because they were white so we just give them something to split these two groups that are otherwise indistinguishable from by giving them these characteristics that they were admitted freely with all the classes of white people the public functions public parks and the best schools so race is deployed specifically through it always has been through things like washrooms through things like public spaces through like access to education those are are ways in which we do it we make sure that the police are drawn from the ranks and the courts reflect them and the voting reflect affects them and that public officials reflect that voting and then we produce newspapers that specialize on news that flatters those poor whites and ignores the the black bodies the brown bodies in the American system accepting crime and ridicule and so this is the deployment of race as a category as a way as a lived experience as a way of thinking and so this here is just a funny Tick Tock from this Creator talking about the ways in which he he says he's he's had to do it so often and so like this has been around since 1935 right like this should be kind of Common Sense stuff and he's having to do it so often and he produces this so often that he tries to dumb down the ways in which uh race and gender and class are deployed in order to understand kind of intersectional experiences so he does it in the kind of the most oversimplified caveman way of producing this these ideas I thought that perhaps I had dumbed it down to the dumbest and easiest level but now we are going to do misogynoir for cavemen black have oppression woman have oppression black women have oppression unique to black woman not simply black oppression or woman oppression new black woman oppression black man having so let's be clear we'll come back to this but Kimberly Crenshaw when she came up with the idea of intersectionality was literally using the metaphor of an intersection whereby black oppression and women's oppression was being treated separately by the courts so much so that they couldn't cover black women's oppression because it was either framed as black oppression or women's oppression and so he's making that distinction here and then we'll continue with this unique oppression black woman have unique oppression both under white oppression white oppression like Swiss army knife many tools many black men try to put away racism but keep patriarchy many black women point out whole tool point out patriarchy hurt black woman black man  about accountability black man very unwilling to part with patriarchy white woman buddy up for convenience white men stay winning black man very unwilling to say patriarchy band black man want Power low-key like white man from patriarchy big problem for black man because it don't work that way anytime black woman point this out black man get very angry black men say guess we blame black man now black man still won't let go of patriarchy black man black woman have other dynamics that if me no make a side four people get pedantic however me point is in-game should not be patriarchy go-to black man in game should be throwing out Swiss army knife if me hear one more comment say take accountability black woman me drop Boulder on head so just this idea so there's a whole bunch of Concepts here that I'm not going to be able to get into in the main lecture I'll add them as an appendix I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that yet but there are many many different dynamics that we just simply don't have the time or place to get into so I'll just kind of put them in a supplementary some of those I mean one of of appropriation of colorism which leads into beauty standards code switching the ability to partake in different majoritarian and minority communities based on how we communicate and the the culture and the expressions from those different majority and minority communities which of course produces majoritarian sensibilities about what should be done that result in things like microaggressions small forms of of hostility towards attitudes and opinions that are not of the majority right we also have intergenerational differences for communities that have migrated or come over and the way they experience race and racism expatriates the concept of expatriates versus immigrants as a kind of global mechanism of of the ways in which we think about white supremacy the racism of design and we'll get into it a bit but this is a fascinating area which I mean Architects architectural issues public issues I've talked about before with the anti-homelessness stuff has been in that and then this persistent problem particularly in political science I'll take the most accountability for that one of the Devil's Advocate right of of taking the abstract subject positioning of well I don't believe this but what if this person did that right that comes immediately from this idea that well I don't have to speak from my experience I'll speak from someone else's experience and I'm not doing that in good faith because I actually want to hear the response I'm doing it in bad faith because it makes you defend a position that no one took in order to waste your time and resources rather than dealing with the issue and so that's what he's getting at the end of the video there again with this idea of respectability and accountability about creating situations where someone has to take accountability and responsibility for something when you don't have to do it at all because you've just played the position of Devil's Advocate and so this is the the the problem is that you know it it cuts both ways in this 20 20 60 of Canadians say racism is a serious problem in Canada so this comes out from that but it's only 60 but at least it's 60 I don't know whether how to understand that um I don't really understand this framing of Canadians starting to identify things for what they are the smacks of a crass materialism as if we're not constantly generating new ways to be racist and new ways to challenge um uh those who would call out forms of hierarchy and oppression um and so this idea of racial transformation transformation and this great social transformation is really just about we've always spoken race we just have spoken it from largely majoritarian sensibilities and refused to listen to non-majoritarian sensibilities um so the ways in which colonialism and white supremacy are kind of bound up in in How We Do politics and that racial justice as as a form of um I mean it's always been an issue with the ways in which we're pushing that issue to be acknowledged and reconciled with at the outset that's why it's in an intro to politics discussion right is it has to be here and it's taking more of a foreground at the outset and so what this is then is about the majority starting to recognize the ways in which it's implicated in forms of race and racism and which is ways it's just refused to in the past so this is Dr Deborah Thompson from McGill and this is her on I think it's the talk or whatever it is the the Canadian morning talk show talking about Canada in particular we were talking about in Canada and I was like Jed have you noticed that I'm the only not white person in this bar and she kind of like stopped and she turned in a circle and she then was like no I I didn't notice at all and to me it's that it's that ability to not notice your whiteness that's the invisibility right it's it's both invisible and it's ubiquitous I don't get to not notice that I'm black that's not something that's possible for me so it's that ways in which this is reproduced and reproduced tacitly and reproduced explicitly reproduced in simple things like what things we memorialize what things we count which cannons we count which voices we listen to which books we read and how that's reproduced and so this has been the great consternation the textbook talks about it quite a bit but we'll go through it as well um with Johnny McDonald um the the idea that we have one of the founders of this nation being an avowed racist at the time uh somewhere I've got it right here so much so that his contemporaries in Parliament were shocked at his racism he was the only one who would use the term Aryan in the 1870s and 1880s and the only member to argue that like different groups were different species and stuff and so this idea then of of him proposing like these these people not having to write the right to vote because they were foreigners was his greatest Triumph and that this idea of of adopting explicitly genocidal policies towards indigenous groups blaming groups for Insurrection and and uh calling for their extermination based on false premises and this Contra contradiction of even the attitudes and opinions at the time and so there's this this tendency to say that this was in the past and therefore because in the past we have learned from it I don't know of any kind of how way that you could conceptualize educational correlation to these things and this is why so this I I documented this I reported this page when it popped up just popped up a couple years ago on on our campus and it was taking something that went around at Berkeley and then framing it at Western as this idea of creating a white students union this this kind of mocking framing of white ignorance as if it could just equate whiteness as the same as other experiences and then produce that in a very specific way and so I don't know if there's any other evidence of that that might be the only evidence I have of that um but this is an ongoing practice on our campus at our school something we have to take seriously and something that isn't in the past but very much of the present
