 so in the effort to deal with what is basically an unresolvable issue at least in its current form because Society itself at a certain level is the problem right the The Binding Together by that which binds together is necessarily exclusionary and you can't get around that um but we do need to analyze and understand the politics of this right and I've got examples of this as well and so the idea here is that the chapter lays out the notion of disability being a peculiar politics because it is a a a overlapping way of res of reflecting the status quo of power right and so people our bodies are going to naturally resist and be dominated and exploited and oppressed by that power but we have to understand how it functions right so this idea of the um farcamon as as the I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right again because it's you got to interact with people right like this type of stuff um so a remedy of poison an escape code and so this is an example and I'll use a video in a second to talk about this um opioids right um it is a remedy that was suggested for severe pain um that also can with overdose be a poison causing addiction or death and then um there is also the reason to dismiss the user as an addict and therefore unsavable not deserving and um someone that is a social ill or harm rather than someone who needs help and assistance now the messed up part about this I can't get into it um John Oliver's got great episodes on this on the Sackler family and their explicit I mean they're explicit Denial in their marketing to doctors about the prescriptions of opioids as a solution to other addiction and pain problems that it was not addictive and that it wouldn't cause social harm it just didn't make any sense listen back in the day when people were concerned about getting people off of alcohol there was a prohibitionist organization that sent heroin and packets around because they believed heroin was better than alcohol this stuff happens all the time it's just not clear to me that addiction is something that's going to end it's just how does society respond to addiction here's a little bit on the opioid crisis but this is really a good example of how it functions both as remedy poison and then it becomes scapegoat we scapegoat China we scapegoat places where it comes from communities that it happens in people that use it um all the rest of it anyways this is New York Times the opioid epidemic it's the deadliest drug crisis killing about 90 Americans every day roughly the same number as car crashes here are short answers to some key questions about the crisis what exactly is an opioid opioids are a class of drugs that interact with opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain they regulate pain and affect the brain's reward or pleasure system which can make people feel high that makes opioids powerful painkillers but also extremely addictive so what is the crisis about the current crisis started in the 1990s with the overprescription of opioid painkillers like Oxycontin over the next decade a growing number of people became dependent on these drugs and for many what started with pills grew into a heroin addiction then in 2014 potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl began entering the drug Supply in large amounts where's the crisis most severe it's worse in the midwest Appalachia and New England but it really is a national problem synthetic opioids are continuing to enter new markets especially in the Northeast and South why has it gotten so much worse in recent years decades of opioid over prescription and influx of cheap heroin and the emergence of fentanyl a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin shouldn't we just stop prescribing opioids not necessarily opioids have improved the quality of life for millions of people particularly cancer patients and those with acute pain and suddenly removing access to opioids from those who are dependent on them to function could easily push people to more dangerous opioids like heroin or counterfeit pills so what can be done there are many variables but any solution would require controlling the distribution of prescription opioids expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and making naloxone an overdose antidote more accessible in addition more controversial ideas like drug checking services or supervised injection sites may be necessary to slow the rise in overdose deaths it's really interesting how we want to keep people alive but we're not sure how much we're willing to do in order to ensure that um all right I'll move on to the next one might as well right now so thinking about disability or different I preferred like different abilities or ableism or abilities in a global context we have to go through the relatively recent U.N convention on the rights of personal disabilities push for inclusion or Equitable treatment but it's still framed as largely individual and medical issue rather than political or cultural concern I don't know how much I want States dealing with like even with that opioid discussion um you can see how we we get a prohibitionist regime very quickly right well let's just block it off we know that drugs won the War on Drugs we have very little evidence that prohibition regimes are effective in the long run um and they cause lots of harm in the short run um that I mean the U.S prison system is a direct relationship to the the War on Drugs right um the mass incarceration right and that whole industry around it so thinking about this then is it it falls in this long tradition of of this need to categorize regulate and control bodies um the social creation of what ability is right there's still all this from the research I'm doing in the military there's this notion of kind of universal service and the idea that that we need people who are are physically capable of doing things in order to be well for certain jobs yes but if you are working in the I.T in the military you probably just need somebody who's going to be able to do it um and that doesn't have anything to do with your physical capabilities right um and so these these Notions about how we create what abilities are needed is largely um framing there's also very specific neurotypical framings of the public and then some you know this is these different ways in which we're starting to acknowledge the ways in which we could be differently um the problem of course is representation right um it's speaking for others particularly those and this has always been the case those who don't have the capacity or ability to speak becomes very highly contentious right um who has the right to speak does that mean that if you don't have the right does that fall to your parents how do we decide that should the state intervene at how do how do we come to those questions when this involves children who should be responsible and what obligations do we have and so um the the textbook then really takes the UN to task for its Fabian socialists assumptions right Fabian socialism again remember it's not attacking the issue head on it's trying to starve out the issue by talking about it over and over again but without specifically telling us how to fix it who's responsible and how it's getting worse or better right it's just bringing it up I'm just bring it up I'm bringing I'm raising awareness right um loves raising awareness even if it's raising awareness causes measurable harm raising awareness becomes the goal and so the impacts of War poverty racial capitalism environment as the producers of uh disablement I mean it costs what like three dollars to put a land mine down and about two to three thousand dollars to remove them and they're all over southeast Asia and they contribute directly to all sorts of of different abilities and and disabilities from the the cost of an ongoing the ongoing costs of a war that ended 50 years ago that actually accomplished very little except Bruce has a book called the right to maim that when we stop doing body counts after the Vietnam War um what we try to do then is not record deaths but we try to injure each other it's really messed up it has really messed up attitudes about how somehow being disabled is as good as says um achieving Victory and so that's kind of yeah it's an interesting concept I don't have time to get into it here but the ways in which we still frame Warfare through ability and disabilities is very kind of dominant um and so the name of the book is the right to maim and kill um all right so in uh 2011 disability is framed as like increasing the burden on States rather than rights or inclusion you can see this immediately like that's why the far command is used because your language that you use in relation to these issues is absolutely political there's no way around it you can't not assess it there is no neutral position on this right going back to stuff we can talk about you going to have to be contentious I'm sorry you might not want the contentious you might not like the contentious but it's there and it's going to be there every time you speak um and so you know these ideas of framing things in terms of disability adjusted life years to calculate productivity due to Lost disability I mean productivity is a gross metric in and of itself because uh um socially reproductive work doesn't count as productivity even though it's required for all societies um productivity you know uh if we shut something down lost productivity is the biggest claim used over and over again by dominant groups to justify why we can't do this that or the other it will undermine productivity we can't have this event we can't have this parade you can't have more holidays because it'll impact productivity a productivity is a is a mechanism of like making people work in ways that dominant groups want them to right and so we also monetize disability um so I've been dealing with this for years with my mom's software because she was a medical transcriptionist and she had to use software on her Windows system uh that was a just abominably bad outrageously expensive because the cnib will end up like subsidizing costs for it so there's this whole economy around overpriced goods for people uh with different abilities that comes from their difference and so this famously was contentious around the fidget Spinners right when something that was used by one Community became popular it became ubiquitous which in one way was good but in other ways and everybody forgot why it was in the first place which is fine right like we're all okay if everybody gets the benefit of something that's the premise of a public good we've just forgotten the value of them and so there's a lot of inability to to think about this except in terms of drain on organizations families stuff like that and so this is this is what the textbook's calling out in this world who World Bank report when the more than one billion people live with some form of disability and can't they just live um nearly uh considered difficulties functioning okay but that's not their problem that's society not providing resources for them uh in the years ahead disability with greater concern because its prevalence is on the ride well yes we're older population we're getting older we're going to have more issues aging populations higher risk of disability ordered people as well as The Chronic health conditions diabetes cardiovascular these disaster yes yes we could link this to all sorts of ways in which Industries have gotten lots of money by making sure that we adopt attitudes and opinions and Lifestyles that are unhealthy and so thinking about the tacit message here is that like the ways in which this is framed in terms of you know how their employment rates are lower and how um a school children out of school may have disabilities and all this it's these are problems that haven't been framed in terms of States having to give Solutions because the UN doesn't want to do that and so this idea then of of um you know removing physical barriers making Health Care affordable training health care workers and with rights-based and invested in services such as as rehab are all kind of ways in which they want to produce a certain outcome but will not are not willing to say it um and so this idea of like one in seven people experiencing this is it's just a kind of it's a common issue of everyone that we either think about or don't right like eyeglasses apparently my eyeglasses are a thing there are lots of innovating ways in which we're trying to like I won't get into it to innovate our way out of these problems but often those Innovations are just new sources of revenue that people haven't thought of before and so it becomes this way of of targeting people individuals as sites of growth for more development and money which I guess is okay if it provides everybody with that good but if it becomes an expense for one particular Community or that Community is seen as a site of new accumulation because they have their because they're differently abled in some way that's also weird and so that's what I'm saying there is no way to to come at this issue and not be kind of grossed out it's why it's it's this the farcamon right it's there it's it's one the other it's one of the three
