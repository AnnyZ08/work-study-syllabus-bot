 okay um let's discuss uh digital technology and democracy um yeah a couple things so I mean this is probably the week I mean the timeline's outlet order here um where I I probably am going to make the basic versions of the Powerpoints available um just because like you so you can see my Edition but can you all see the data because I like the texts are okay but they missed the point sometimes it's why we're not using the international orders week and we're not using the ipe week they're they're too General they're not giving us a good analysis and I don't feel they're they're contributing a lot um I normally teach the Cyber politics course which is fourth year course so I have lots of data from that so I'm going to bring in some of those examples some of the data some of those tick tocks those type of things so what are we going to talk about today um unpack the concept of digital politics a bit I have a tough time knowing the difference and I mean I I've seen this many times with cybernetics predates computers the application of technology to the political world has always been a thing and it never won't be a thing and so we just are trying to identify maybe ways that politics has changed certainly there's new things like a deep fake is kind of new um though we've always had propaganda and we've always had you know misinformation and disinformation like that's basic Warfare right like all that stuff existed so we're going to try to identify ways in which things have changed I I'm I tend to be a bit of a skeptic on the like the radical transformation that has taken place normally what and this is this goes back to the we have never been modern LaTour stuff right it's his insights are that like yes you can use the internet to prove the flat earth right like there's no necessarily teleological foundation for new technologies there certainly can be increases in productivity but what that means is always socially embedded right um and supporting and threatening democracy again I don't think those claims can be made we can have positive this chapter does it we can do positive or negative ways of thinking about it um and so there's a couple things I mean it's kind of complicated maybe I think this generation's the most heavily digital users that we've had but they're not particularly you don't understand because of the way that we've developed it like the language encodes are are not transparent to you whereas with early internet we would have had to learn a bit of coding to do stuff right so those types of things so the ways in which we understand the world changes um you know a broad range of applications and devices that connect to one another I would say not necessarily necessarily through an internet because you can have a network with it that's not connected to the internet right um and digital Technologies websites emails social media instant messaging podcasting mobile devices sure video audio those type of things um and so this idea then of having digitally enabled politics and digitally based politics um sure that that boundary really doesn't hold and so Technologies may be new but digital politics has been around since the 1990s um what no no no no no no no um so when we teach the cyber attacks these go back to the 80s 70s 60s we have been having technology enabled forms of political um messing about I don't know if you call Crime political or not anyways so what we have here this is a whistle that came in boxes of Captain Crunch and the um early telephone systems so when there used to be a thing called pay phones where in public places you would put money in in order to use a phone uh the ways in which those phones told the system that you had paid was by the the tones that it um emitted unfortunately this Captain Crunch whistle emitted the exact same tones as the money uh putting it into a pay phone so people figured out that they could hack these systems very early on MIT has been doing hacking for for decades hacking is just the unauthorized or unpredicted use of a technology in a way that wasn't predicted so the idea here is that if we're going to talk about things like technology I think starting at the 90s makes very little sense because some of these questions are the exact same questions we've been dealing with since the 1960s probably maybe even a bit before the um you know computers are basically big filing cabinets right so they have data um that everybody either wants to get access to or we want to stop people from getting access to um and so the NSA has been working with these systems the National Security Agency in the US since the 60s in almost every form and so um the main problem is not that these Technologies are new it's that humans use them and so their human vulnerabilities throughout individual accidents or deliberate acts can jeopardize the information in a system like these are Insider threats we've got them all the time we've always had them in spying and so just having technology enabled doesn't change the fact that we've always tried to get people to spy for us and against us and so these are all built into computer computers communication systems consoles they have vulnerabilities in the systems organized so you can like the the oldest form of kind of social engineering is just you know calling up someone and say oh my computer's not working give me your password or you know all of these sophisticated phishing attacks we get now oh it's your boss can you just uh shoot me over you know 25 I need it blah blah blah I got hit last year everybody in our department got an email from the chair saying oh I need some I think it was the Amazon gift cards and at first it looked like it came from the proper address because the way that um westerns Microsoft uh kerning the the literal fonts allow it to manipulate us because what might actually be an r and an N looks like an m so it looks like it comes from a real address or it can be spoofed and so the idea here this isn't new right um you know who are the class of users what's the environment what's the skill um you know all of these these problems have always existed so to say that like cyberpolitics is new I may be in the political round but I'll give you examples that that's not true either so since the 60s we know that computers could spill sensitive data since the 70s we know computers could be attacked and data was stolen in the 80s and 90s we knew that we you know could build computer techs into nuclear arsenals and that others may be trying to to do so and developing these things so as early as 1968 the NSA had had um five acres of floor space working on Computing problems and so we'll talk about this throughout this this week but this is I I do think the insights of cyber politics is it's a good critique of the idea of security as conceived of by the state as a noun rather than security as a verb as we've got some level of security but that level of security is constantly changing because someone just figured out oh this Captain Crunch whistle can break into our phone systems right and so absolute security is largely fictive you can spend an infinite amount on security um you can you can spend more and more but this is the old what it was in politics called guns or butter so as a society you can either spend 800 billion on the military or you can spend the 800 billion on development infrastructure and internet Technologies which allow you to mess with the society instead of spending 800 billion I don't know which one's better certainly if you're going into a war you want guns but if you're not in a war having seems to make more sense and so when it comes to security you can spend all of your butter on on security but at some point you're basically going to have to accept that there's a level of vulnerability here and so we aren't ever secure we have forms of security or degrees of security and so we use security like a noun when it really should be a verb this is the recent one now I have a phone right now that um uh Reddit uh the Reddit app will not install on because it's an old version of the Android operating system and um I think it's Motorola and Motorola refuses to put updates into it um so I can't get on to the latest version of apps and stuff um and these system Securities and vulnerabilities are are baked into the the hardware now so should I stop using it because it's not secure even though it functions but it just increasingly over time is less functional on some things it's perfectly fine device but increasingly we have these problems where it's two years out firms will not update the security on your phone which makes it super vulnerable and so this idea of at least providing us with some idea of how long you're going to get updates on your phone would would be important because your personal security all your stuff's on your phone and if you're telling me that a phone only lasts two years and I'm on a three-year payment plan that seems to be a problem and these phones like an Apple phone being worth you know upwards to two thousand dollars so it's weird these problems are not just virtual they are deeply political problems too um what happened was uh back in the 70s and 80s somebody put a training tape into one of the early nuclear defense systems it showed uh on November 9th 1979 it uh warning screen showed 1400 Soviet IB icbms approaching North America and NORAD concluded that an attack was underway um that said uh they got this and the the um I consider the situation very serious they almost went to nuclear war they almost fired their uh question their all of their missiles in response to somebody putting the wrong tape in the system um that seems political to me I the death of every human on the planet because somebody puts a wrong tape and seems like a problem um and so what this did it created this they made a movie out of it Matthew broderick's war games um and then it becomes this thing and this happens all the time in cyber security somebody conceives of something in a fiction space and then that becomes conceived of as a security threat and so actual fiction work is framing how we secure we see ourselves so this this war Games movie comes out and then Ronald Reagan references it in a joint uh Jesus staffs meeting the high school students see this and they create a hacking group and they find basically that there's about 8 000 Network systems back in the 80s without any security and the high school kids are just able to mess around with them right um so early on the NSA starts setting standards for for research and security for all government systems um you know in 1986 we have had 75 accounting error that that discovered that West German hackers have been paid by the KGB to enter into all the networks and it was that accounting era that allowed them to discover that their their networks were totally insecure and had been run over and so the idea here is that information Warfare isn't new um these ideas of having systems that are vulnerable that are also information providers is going to um uh to tell the groups what's happened I saw a thing um when they were planning the the Normandy invasion we sent over thousands of inflatable tanks and weapon systems inflatable so that we would provide disinformation actively to the enemy who thought our troops were over here when they're there so the idea of providing information as part of warfare isn't anywhere new I mean the Trojan Horse is the we still call them Trojans right the the idea of providing false information here's a gift that's actually a threat is as old as politics I would say and so we don't have and this is what the NSA discovered that there is no such thing as a kind of a secure system as long as humans are involved there's going to be vulnerabilities I mean after the the Snowden leaks the head of the NSA said we're going to try to fire every single human and men and try to do this all with with um programming and system and algorithms because humans are vulnerable humans are security risk right um as all sci-fi tells us and so you know this idea of of having security especially in a cyber space is very um suspect the NSA by the 80s says we don't think we can secure any system that all systems are built on code and all code is vulnerable to to to either Hardware or software vulnerabilities and those vulnerabilities make us insecure um and so I mean the Pentagon holds hack the Pentagon events now to try to figure out where all their insecurity is it used to be keep the hackers away now it's no let's bring in all the Securities Google does this all the all the software companies do this they they provide incentives now for to find bugs find hacks find fix and we'll pay you so we can close it um and we do this all the time that um you know uh the we're trying to develop new security standards so right now they're working on the uh the post Quantum cryptography standards so the the National Institute for standards and technology in the US has been holding competition for going on years now trying to figure out what's the system we can use that is quantum proof so when they develop these quantum computers we can be sure that our data isn't going to be instantly um insecure by these systems um they had a bunch of Front Runners and then you subject everybody to them and one of them that they'd already made it through several rounds of competition somebody found a paper from 1997 that said oh by the way there's a massive vulnerability we can't use that anymore and so this idea of of systems being secure um is a problem of humans aren't secure and so this is a famous XKCD um discussion of how stupid passwords are fundamentally if we went back in time we would get rid of passwords um they don't make sense they are really hard for humans to remember and they're very easy for systems to crack and we haven't developed them this idea that we have to rotate them and come up with them and have all of these these complex mathematical ways to to do this it I have really made these systems passwords in particular have I been pawned just check if your password has been compromised I believe mine's company compromised 26 30 times one of them's on a forum for Xboxes the original Xbox I used to mod them so you could play like pirated games um I can't delete it from that Forum the The Forum has no capacity for me to delete it my data is there forever and so I used a password like 15 years ago that's still there and it can't be changed it's not going to be changed there's no point changing it right so it doesn't this over and over again so we don't develop systems that are human based we develop systems for technology and then are shocked when humans become the vulnerability and so this idea is that in the the 1960s these problems of computer cyber security were too difficult to solve on their own and most of them still haven't been solved some of them are at the basic level and so what we get then is this danger of thinking of Technology as outside of politics and security what I'm going to try to do is re-embed them and say all of these issues are actually just the same social issues we've been dealing with before we think that things will provide things so we think that crypto is going to fix the broken money system we think that I don't know web 3 is going to decentralize the internet we think that large language models are going to break the way that we do things maybe in ways but if there was something like a uniform surface of humans that might make sense we are not a uniform surface of humans and that is to say there are a bunch of assumptions built in to a lot of this technological stuff that is based in Silicon Valley where I'll talk about the Silicon Valley ethos move fast break things white males envisioning a space upon which they can create whatever they want where this is standard kind of subtler colonial stuff it's built into technology and then we get all of these ways in which we react to that technology if as if technology is problem not Society right like this has been arguments in the past about technology birth control makes people promiscuous um still one of the reasons that the you know the Catholic church for example has had such a a history with birth control um uh junk food makes people violent this was literally the defense used in the killing of of Harvey Milk um the first kind of famous politician who was who was gay um video games are addictive okay what isn't addictive public cars and public transportation are making people obese sure I don't know we find them appealing though to kind of like say that technology is outside of politics or outside of the social and that when you dig into it you see that we just replicate all these patterns on different platforms but I guess it sounds new to say that technology has changed everything in order to get more interest in technology changing everything it becomes a kind of tautological system
