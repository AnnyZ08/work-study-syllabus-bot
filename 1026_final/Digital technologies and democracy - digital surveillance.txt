 so the values that come then from these different Platforms in the social context in which they're embedded are necessarily going to reflect those values and ideas there was a Google employee who actually started a a subscription who was pushing for a subscription-based search system as an alternative to Google it never actually came to Canada it started in the US and now it's been destroyed um it's been destroyed because the premise was a search is fundamentally compromising your results SEO search engine optimization is you know being on the front page of Google is like 90 of your business if you can get there you you are so desperate to stay there you're willing to pay money to get to the front that's why the search is so bad that process the insidification in a search and so search has this way of reflecting social values and Google's kind of commercialism or you know shareholder value it's a business it's been doing that in the past though this idea was that there was all this data on the internet and the search was the way to get to it the problem is is that like in society search reproduces certain Norms because it's it's searching the dominant group it's searching for the most rather than the best so today I took it upon myself have to type into Google professional hairstyles for women guess what popped up all these white women all of these Karen's right let me searching Champion styles for men guess what popped up all these white men okay all right not the white man not the white man so I'm like okay let me see something let me type in unprofessional hairstyles for men guess what popped up my black men my black man tell me please I'm confused what is unprofessional about this a haircut dreads are unprofessional make it make sense okay so let's tape in unprofessional hairstyles for women guess what popped up this is unprofessional My Curls are unprofessional Google fix it because I don't like nothing about it I don't like so this is the problem and this is what Noble talks about in algorithms of Oppression is the search supposed to reflect the most if it's supposed to reflect the most then it's going to reflect dominant cultures values and ideas including racism if it's supposed to re reflect the truth which is that yes this is totally racist then you have to do what everybody's terrified of doing which is this idea of you should deal with the ways in which your depiction of the social world is reinforcing the racism of the social World which means then you should have Progressive search engines you should have politicized search results not that we haven't always had politicized search results because the search results are already racist but that if you want to counter these you should do that so Noble talks about this like just in profs so she has examples in your book and we have to screen cap this I do it all the time I screencap things because it's gone so what happened was if you typed in like University Professor you would get a whole bunch of white men you can see it now with with llms in chat or um mid-journey just in mid-journey you give it like the idea of what is this what is that people have already done it um that you could say like what does a university Professor look like what is this and so it's predominantly white people and older and they look a certain way and they have a certain style and all the rest of that so the problem which has always been here is that that's going to reflect those values so if we are changing that we are doing something else we are making search not search we are making search how we want search to be or how we envision Society to be search itself is a heavily contested concept and so we can't just do that and so you know um these ways in which what a search does I want to see if it's true so funny comedians okay pretty normal not funny comedians all women so what what I mean by we have to capture this data is that Google will go in once they hear about this and change the algorithm so they are always already doing this right they're doing what produces the most commercial outcome and all the rest of that but when they're doing it for profit we're like okay with it but when they do it because somebody brought attention to the fact that um university professors were all coming up as white then one of the algorithm then somebody on the back end goes in and change the algorithm we have no oversight over these things so one of the things that the gdpr the general data protection regulations in the European Union stemmed from was a Google versus Spain case where somebody in Spain said every time somebody searches my name in Google you're bringing up my bankruptcy that came up like 15 years ago that was in the news I should as a human right have a right to privacy and the right to be forgotten that the search shouldn't amplify something that Society has said I've discharged is in my past and I've moved on from and so the right to be forgotten is is about the political regulation of search and so we just don't have those regulations here they just simply don't happen here and so all of these books deal with these issues in Noble's book in particular deals with all of the kind of racism that's embedded in society that gets reflected in all of our data in all of our searches and so when we're thinking about digitally based politics then we have to think about the ways in which we're reproducing the politics and actions online um the this idea that we become I I mean for example if you're trying to mobilize and this is what's happening um so much of us are online that now the politicians have to spend all their money on these search engines which raises the question or these platforms like Facebook and Google all the rest of it but it raises the questions tick tock then do we what's the obligation of these platforms or should they be taking speech that is hateful that a politician is saying in their election campaign and remove it because it violates terms of service our terms of service more important than the values of the society and so you can see this in the reverse too if you say buy a platform and you decide you're going to be a free speech Advocate and you just literally remove all the trust and safety Engineers so that people are now using it to propagate searches for illegal content or child sex abuse material or things like that and you don't have the infrastructure there are you obligated to have that infrastructure and how should we regulate you so we've got a bunch of different examples here I'll bring them in surveillance misinformation and hashtag activism I mean surveillance is ubiquitous I kind of always has been I mean the church meeting a church at a church on Sunday is a form of social surveillance I'm visiting the temple and praying is a form of social surveillance we do this all the time and social surveillance and and information control right like about what what you should be reading what should be thinking what she'd be doing we've always done this um the idea here is that we're generating and so this is one of the attitudes of the gdpr is that data is should be perceived of as radioactive it's something you want to put in sites that are safe you want to minimize its exposure and you want to not have a lot of it um it's this is data minimization actually Canada has this as well in pipita it's their Privacy Information I can't ever remember personal Access Data act it's just like when I've asked let's say major government officials are you actually trying to data minimize here like you're expected to they're like why would we do that we have access to all this information we should use it and so we've got all these problems over and over again of of surveillance being in virtually every aspect of our life um and particularly authoritarian governments can monitor harass detained citizens um president yeah all over the place but I mean it's it's literally everywhere China's great firewall of China has a sophisticated surveillance economy um tens of thousands of people like to to monitor the internet report and block harmful content and I'm okay with blocking harmful content um we've always done it right uh some of the greatest works of literature were on the were written under the tsarist regime in Russia where you weren't allowed to use all sorts of words and so it makes people very creative when they have to work under under uh systems of censorship and control so I don't know that it's different I I think there's this belief that all good all information is good information but I think this whole lecture has been about democratization of Internet doesn't necessarily produce better outcomes if we don't have ways to socially or technologically or government forms of Regulation right I don't think that the top like draws on Tick Tock should be teenage girl dances when the bulk of their audiences are 50 plus year old men it seems to me that's a problem that somebody should address but we because of the the this kind of double blind of the company won't let us know what they see and we don't see what everyone's doing we think it's okay right and so we would hope that there is more systems uh this is an old classic example this is the Blackberry CEO being asked Point Blank about whether or not people in uh specifically I think was south Asia and the Middle East can be assured that they have security when they are using a BlackBerry device this is back when Blackberry mattered and you're confident that we we've got a lot of um uh listeners and and viewers in the Middle East and in India you can confidently tell them they're going to have no problems with being able to use their blackberries and you being able to give them assurance that everything um that's over interview's over please you can't use that Rory that's just not fair that's not fair well uh sorry I dealt with this come on this is a national security issue turn that off so perfect the National Security matter turn that off um so uh citizen Lab at U of T Ron debert's been doing this work for a couple decades now a couple decades yeah I guess we're at a couple decades um so they have lots of evidence on this all the ways in which this has happened so these are this is this data is a bit old now doesn't matter it's probably got worse I think there's a bunch of Western Nations on this list too so um open it information allows us to to audit it to review it and so this was one of the things that they looked at and so they had evidence of filtering by all of those countries they had suspected filtering in Belarus and Kazakhstan and these were the types of things that were being filtered um from the internet everything from Human Rights women's rights environmental issues Economic Development Public Health gay lesbian content pornography dating gambling alcohol or drugs minority faiths hacking blogging free emails search engines P2P commercial sites I think we should regulate hate speech I think there should be regulations on who can access pornography and gambling those are things that I understand their regulation I just don't know how you ask people in positions of authority to then say that we're not going to just add another word to that cue list that gets banned and so this idea of of digital surveillance has increasingly shown that we are doing these things all the time as well that's what Snowden was saying is that the NSA is actively spying on people and let's be clear they're one of the first things in the report that happened the employees that have access to this surveillance this happens almost uniformly it was happening with the nest cameras I think it was happening with Amazon and it was happening with the NSA one of the first things they get access to and share are their exes nudes because they have access to it on the back end and this has been well documented and so the idea here is that if you give this power to people without oversight the first thing they do is immediately exploit the power right because it's powerful and they want to use it and so um you want to have law enforcement to to combat all of those things it's just that for example in combating trafficking concerns cesta and Foster were passed in the U.S which basically shut down the capacity for sex workers to have forums where they regulated the people that they interacted with including those that would cause them physical harm and so the idea of regulating trafficking is also used as a Prohibition regime against sex work so it creates there there isn't any way to regulate without producing these consequences intended or unintended and so digital surveillance is how we track Travelers it is what is Need for for intelligence right you can't have intelligence without surveillance it's part of it the question is who should be doing their surveillance and what can they do and all the rest of it one of the weird interesting Parts about having this security intelligence sharing system that we've had with the five eyes network is that technically if the U.S takes data that it gets on Canadian citizens it can fully surveil it because they're foreigners and then it can provide the the summary of that data back to the Canadians as actionable Intel but that doesn't hold up in a Canadian court because they're they're um we would have to get that data through legal means we have protections Canadian government cancer Villas but the other four can and we can surveil the other four as well and so it creates this web of surveillance by uh security Partners who want to be able to do things and still respect privacy and rights um and so you know I don't really care about the covet alert app like it was clear Bruce Schneider said immediately the the kova detection app wouldn't work because of apartment buildings right being next to an apartment where somebody has covered the tracking and surveillance it rendered it moot right and it simply wasn't adopted you will not have all of these systems depend on the idea that Engineers come up with well if we have a hundred percent use of this technology it will work we don't have anything like that we we took the longest time it took Snowden before we had our websites put basic https Security on them until we had https that meant that everything you were doing on the internet could be surveilled by almost anybody at any time right like it this is not the systems were not based on security back to the stuff of the first video so what we now have is private companies actually developing this software for these companies or for these countries so the NSO group in particular has been highlighted for this because they have this uh a pegasus spyware I think it was used to hack Bezos right that's that's what led to his divorce um was the um trying to blackmail him with this information he just came out and said no I did it and you can't get anything on me um and so the idea here is that this is a private firm operating out of um Israel that uh has access it will buy security exploits so if you have a vulnerability you've discovered covered in Apple or Android it will buy that from the person and then keep it proprietary so they can send messages to your phone immediately take it over with no notification from you so Apple in particular and meta as well have pushed for the US to ban this company because it's effectively undermining the National Security and foreign interests of the US this company is but it's just as available to places like Pakistan and it was probably used to as part of the murder of Jamal khashoggi which is what Saudi Arabia did and so this technology then is being used to facilitate the violation of Human Rights by one company in one country and so this idea of of these digital Technologies producing better outcomes we can also see the ways in which it's being used by states to effectively surveil monitor attack and undermine the interests of what they see as dissidents in their societies
