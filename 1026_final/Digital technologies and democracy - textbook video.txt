 okay so this is the textbook video and the conclusion yes things are both positive and negative okay but they're very contested as well um it can also you know it could lead to empowerment I don't know if it leads does democracy breed democracy or does democracy breed group think I'm not sure um of course they vary across political systems they reflect those systems and that it's going to to be an issue we didn't really talk about the digital divide it's it's become more complicated in recent years um primarily because there are more cell phones on the internet than people at this point I'm pretty sure um saturation is I mean most people have at least one sitting in a drawer somewhere now totally wasteful but whatever um and so the question is you know in many places this is only like text based access but you know there's lots of places that have you know especially throughout Africa have the primary means of paying us through a cell phone so it's also that kind of banking and all the rest of it I don't know yes they're in terms of high-speed internet access there's absolutely divides a particular encounter because our infrastructure is so clustered and our population is so distributed particularly with indigenous communities so there are still basic access issues Arctic for example I wrote a paper on Arctic internet access years ago um and so this idea then is is that we are we reproduce more inequalities all the time one of the gross truisms of the kind of tech sector is whenever they and try to increase the um EDI D equality diversification decolonization of these sectors as they generally go down in terms of pay it's gross so the question then becomes are they doing it on purpose or not and so the exclusivity of your information and your abilities is what drives up your income and the more skills that people have the lower people are going to pay for it right and so this idea of inclusion and exclusion just being based in the ideas themselves no it's based on who gets to speak and how why you would so many cool things on the internet and why we just talk to a Prof and I guess because it's just on the associate press you can get it for free I don't know let's listen to it it's a problem because people believe it and they don't know the difference between what's real and what's not I don't know the difference between what's real and what's not we didn't talk about this at all I did want to talk about this a kind of the digital appropriation but this idea that if we can create all these virtual spaces are we going to create boundaries on what you're going to put what your touch-up levels and settings are on things are we going to have these debates about how we should accurately portray ourselves online what we should and shouldn't include I think we're we're seeing a really troubling time with news consumption right now where people are going to sources that confirm what they already think when a fake news article appears in their social media feed and they like the way it sounds they don't bother to vet whether it's true or not and they pass it on and then somebody else passes it on and pretty soon you have everybody believing that something has happened when it hasn't of course it's dangerous I mean we have a long history of false flags being used to start wars it can be wrong but be useful and we should be conscious of that I also don't know like what is a hypothesis it's just a wild claim that you have to support with evidence right okay isn't that what we all do I mean look what look what happens I mean somebody thought that that news in quotations was worthy of investigating and took a rifle and and went after the the pizza parlor I don't know how we stop it that pizza parlor that apparently had a basement where all this bad stuff was happening except it didn't actually have a basement I mean people love fake news they love a good conspiracy theory I mean we're at a period in American history where they're an awful lot of people who are have you heard of the Salem witch hunts and the witch trials I'm not sure that fake news is new I just think that maybe the social utility of it isn't being utilized to maximum degree again Iraq war fearful of establishment who want change but that change what was the premise of the Vietnam War right like the premise was the Domino Theory so because academics said it was so we should all go fight and die to stop the spread of Communism which by the way Vietnam is now communist so I just just coming at a cost and that cost is we are not better informed just because we have more sources of information we're less informed because we're not looking for news we're not looking for so what's the I've been struggling with this lately what is the point of a debate I think debate is more in the realm of rhetoric than reason because if you really want to reasonably assess the veracity of a policy you would need to know what the outcome is going to be the problem is is in our open system we don't know what the outcomes are going to be we try to achieve them and then we reproduce myths all the time so trichodon economics still maintains it's still put out there um all IMF the World Bank everybody has said trickle Downs economics does not work it's not true but people still believe it and they adopt it as a policy and they tell it to people and those people say well I'm going to vote for that person because they believe that that making my taxes smaller or that my taxes paying less taxes produces better outcomes right or that if you give more money to the people at the top it trickles down to the bottom no evidence to support that but when we know there's no evidence to support that and policy makers still support it we're in the realm of rhetoric and I think all policy is rhetoric because we it's not truth it's the implementation of its certain idea and then the world will either correspond to that idea or not so I don't know um am I a cyber Optimist skeptic or pessimist I don't know you tell me um what are digitally supported politics lots of them um what type of digital politics have you engaged in I don't know what that is is it any form of like if I found out so let's say I went to a protest because I found out a bit through an email I said digital politics what if I in the past found it out through a flyer is that media politics I'm not sure so we have these cyberoptopism skepticism uh I'm clearly I think the skeptic a digital campaigning digital government digital based identity surveillance hashtag actor has a misinformation there's no disinformation which I think it needs to be there I also think sharp power should be on there it's likely one that I would want to put on evaluation like in terms of an exam
