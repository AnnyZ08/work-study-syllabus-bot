 so I'm not trying to be nillest or anything here um I will say that um we only know this stuff because we learn more all the time we have to be introduced by already to understand some of the significance of what's happening what we're doing we can't just have it as a singular field and there's too much of these policy outcomes or that that United Nations video that just assumes that somehow like the UN alone could pass a a law but again it would be up to states to implement them so it's not clear that the UN even has the capacity to make these changes that we would want and that we would need all those other analyzes to understand things like the Amazon decolonization so there is a a this is I think it's from the dark Mountain Manifesto just a weird kind of Manifesto dealing with this stuff is that a lot of how we think about progress or about human kind of history and development is about this idea of a relationship to nature which is one where we are destined for greatness and the greatness is cost free we are part of the world but better than it we're distinct in that we have separated ourselves in the Triumph of how we think we we have overtaken nature in one this is our our Glory this is how we think about ourselves we we don't we don't recognize the way in which that fundamentally distorts our relationship to the world right we don't think of the earth as sacred we we don't put ourselves as another mammal alongside the rest um we think ourselves as exterior to it um and so this idea of climate change as a lived experience is that we are destructive force of nature we have changed the course of nature but if we're nature then I don't know what that means and that climate volatility and uncertainty is now the norm and so what is natural is like there's nothing there's everything natural about a media hitting a planet but at the same time there's nothing natural about it right the word nature doesn't mean a whole lot there's a whole lot that emerges from this idea of of what it is to be nature we've con traditionally thought about this idea of like nature is a limitless store of resources for us we have the capacity to do it it's malleable the most effective uh means of raising liver standards is economic growth which it has been but it has an environmental cost right ever expanding material abundance we create things under our control as if we choose the outcomes that we need a work ethic that we have to be diligent and then there's a freedom and material abundance we think it is free and so we're not clear that this has particularly product produced the best outcomes when we look at it in an ecological perspective we're not actually taking things and looking at like the 70 billion chickens we kill every year we don't think of those as we think of them as food right which is fine it's just I'm not sure that that's the most ecologically sound way to do it and so a lot of social justice arguments about these things ecological Justice arguments are framed in humans terms so we want to keep something because it is valuable to us literally for our survival and so the UN then is is primarily an that should be an anthropo-centric organization and then there's something like we need to pers protect non-human politics I think this is Naomi Klein from 2000 uh fine uh 2004. um our economic system and our planetary system are at War our economy is at war with life on Earth including human life the climate needs to avoid collapse as a contraction of the use of resources our economic model um demands you know unfettered expansion to grow and one of the sets of rules can change and it's not going to be the laws of nature and so we have this fundamental tension in how we think about the relationship of of humans to the world and and how we can accomplish uh these ends and so thinking about this then it's not at all clear that Marxism State socialism social democracy liberalism how about a whole lot to say about this they've largely left these questions alone and listen the the Soviet system was a particular level of horror when it comes to the environment because of the lack of feedback mechanisms of a centrally controlled command economy at least in open systems you can complain when you are being systemically poisoned you just hope as we'll talk about a bit later when we're dealing with Pacific island nuclear colonialism you just hope that people hear and care and so this is also about this idea of the majority deciding again and the ways in which we can do this and so we have this long history of of the ways in which human expansion has also been about the transformation of the world um you know the British brought back all the species from their colonial encounters and spread biome and bacteria around the world famously when the the British got to the Himalayas they came in contact with the bacteria that got on them and then got on their ships and rotted all the wood in the British Empire so they had to shift to metal based hulls because of bacteria and so a lot of the reasons that we pick the plants that we have and the ones that propagate are because we decide what matters we decide which ones are pretty and the messed up part is that plants then in their systems and symbiotics the ones that fry Thrive are going to be the ones that are attractive to us and so we still eat and part of the reason we have so much food waste is because we eat with our eyes and we don't like to eat misshapen food and so we throw out all of it I talked about the carrots example before and so so much of how even our our food systems are generated are based on anthropocentric views of how we should decide on which things should be grown which things shouldn't be grown what are sustainable what are good remember chicken wings back in the day right Americans didn't eat that part of the chicken it was totally wasteful and then in Buffalo somebody didn't have anything but the wings left over threw them in a deep fryer and now we kill on mess there's a a glut of chicken breasts after the Super Bowl because we eat so many Just Wings right so we change the the the world around us because of this and so the politicization of nature is always bound up in The Human Experience this for example was one that I described as these ideas about how what is an invasive species is about what types of vegetal experiences we value and don't and how we politicize nature as valuable to communities not humanity and so we've got this over and over again and based of plants to to watch for invasiveness is not a scientific category it's a deeply political one we don't like to think I from an indigenous perspective I have a tough time not thinking that settler colonialism doesn't look like an invasive I guess we're since there were the same species it's it's a different type of invasion but we immediately do this this is a book there that Peter Coates has that talks about like the the instant that the the Colonials um social contract settlers settle they immediately start turning on things that they see as natural and unnatural um we we bring stuff with us right all of those things that I showed in that Padma video before that nothing in the apple pie is indigenous North America it comes with this this settler movement the colonial movements of of things and in 1883 there was a campaign the immigrants brought over sparrows with them to North America and then they turned on those sparrows as being um if poverty filthful and tenements that real American birds were losing to these sparrows that came in as an invasive species and so what codes is talking about is like how do we decide what is good and bad and ugly clean and dirty health and health healthy they largely come back to our majority sensibilities about the way we should use things you know chicken feet used to be seen as food waste there is no such thing as food waste you can figure out ways to do it awful right like brains gallbladders gizzards those type of things lots of different communities have figured out ways to consume them but different communities decide what what is food waste what is edible and what isn't right we decide that we don't eat pets because we see that as different but yet we we kill cows we race horses babies horse racing is babies we we raise babies and we make money off babies this year has been particularly bad for horse racing thousands of them were dying in the last several years horse racing because we say that we want to bet on horses baby stock let's be clear because they're under two they're babies my wife's a horse riding instructor she doesn't they don't even in her sport they don't even get on them until three or four because they're not they're too little and in horse racing we just do it so how we decide what is troublesome how we decide what is it belongs and what doesn't what is a stranger is totally based on in-group and out group species um this idea even that in New England Federalist Papers had all these racist fears that the Irish and the French were alien to what did North American or the American Experience was American is apple pie is a saying and yet nothing from it is indigenous to North America and there's a long history of the ways in which biopiracy which the colonial experience grabs things and throws them somewhere else I don't have time for it I wrote a paper about this but um Henry Ford famously wanted to create Ford landia this this this image of a perfect uh town in Brazil where he could grow all of the um the rubber for the the Ford cars um but he brought in these and tried to create these fields it didn't work at all the soil wasn't good and there was bacteria and it didn't work at all but when they did do it in Indonesia it there was no natural Predators it and that's where we still get rubber from to this day so the ways in which crops flourish and have predators and not Predators is very much bound up in human systems so humans absolutely are embedded in non-human systems but we think of them as subject to our whims how we think about them and so this is a human Central Prejudice that we don't actually think about the ways in which we are co-evolved with other species like everything on the planet is at the same level of evolution of as us but we think that we are somehow Superior and this is what leads to things like global warming or the idea that it's okay to do that there are alternatives this is a book in particular Susan Hale talks about the the history of this she goes through all the traditions of this the ways in which indigenous knowledge is like many places around the world have different experiences to Nature have more sustainable experience of Nature and that they belong to and rather not above that nature so this is in the genre actual the actual translation of the names of Mohawk Oneida anodega Cayuga and Seneca people of the Flint people of the sanding Stone people at the hills people the marsh area people of the Great Hills so it's your identity is bound up with where you are and what you do there is not this this clear there's a relationship it's not a separation or and so we have all of these these Frameworks even the the creation stories Great Law of Peace and the the good message of handsome lake is all about the relationship and you see these in the stories all the time of of non-human persons having a significant role on on the impact of human persons they're just different persons right um and so we've got this it's it's embedded in the structures and the ways of thinking about the Confederacy the tree of peace and so here's just the tree of Peace again that I've mentioned at the beginning but this is more about the the its impact which we should do we should think in a multi-disciplinary way the idea of a peace treaty also being about ecology we just don't do that [Music] stock volume anyway [Music] foreign [Music] so this idea of the lawfulness of practice is not some type of human universalism it's got the life of the planet at the center right it's got the tree at the center and so this idea of of these these changing relationships but this is a choice right this is a conscious Choice it's a they weren't always this way this wasn't always this way that's the whole point is that you have to make the choice in order to produce the peace and have this at its Center and we're just not sure the tree of peace is at the center and so we don't really think about that we also don't think about the ways in which agriculture is about settlement practices right there's a whole bunch of debates I'm not going to get into them but food science debates food history anthropology debates about why humans settled or or continue to migrate in the ways they do one of the theories is beer right people in order to have beer they had to settle and farm and in order to farm that created the settlements and that's how we did things interestingly enough the HUD and Ashanti when after the Great Law of Peace and and the encounter with um settlers they shifted their survival strategies because you couldn't right like the the grossness of reserves but the idea of traditional hunting trapping and the ability to move and and live off the land shifted into farming as a survival strategy and it it grew out of this ancient practice this is an ecologically sound practice of the three sisters corn beans and squash go together because they help the nitrogen helps each other they naturally resist pests and they also provide a livelihood and these are you know family plots forestry practices abridging strategy from pre-contact to post contact is reflected in the ways in which settlement happens and so we don't like to think about the idea of of the ecological as bound up in how we do things and the the changing nature that has and so we just have all of these ways in which we think about invasive species as wrecking the way I do things that weed weed right is not a scientific thing weed on my lawn must go I must put pesticide and fertilizer in order to make my grass uniform as if that makes sense especially in the U.S the ecological disaster that is just watering and herbicide and farming and maintenance of Lawns that made sense in the British experience where you have a lot of rain and you want to protect erosion but in places like Arizona or New Mexico or Nevada where you have golf courses you have this this sense of political ecology that's totally backwards right and so this idea of thinking about the ways in which you produce this and political ecology can look to these Alternatives but we have to be open to doing that and it's not clear without a perspective that decenters the human from the the the core of it that we're gonna start to get anywhere with this stuff and I'm not sure I mean we didn't have any of these examples in the textbook so if we're going to talk about this idea changing the way we do things there are examples out there but we've got to look for them
