 so we have a lot of discussion this chapter about um the gender binary sure if we're challenging the Western gender binary reproducing the gender binary in what we see kind of seems like we're losing before we started but okay we don't call them spectrums we don't call them polls we don't want to talk about that um I mean women have been occluded from excluded from the social contract because they were unfit it's deeper than that I would say going back to Aristotle it was a notion that they weren't fully human and that this has plays over in colonialism and how we think about these things and that we still have claims today about um talking about women's rights or or you know no fault divorce I think I've got a tick talk about no fault divorce just the idea that that we can directly correlate these things I looked it up and I made sure I checked the study but like that this the suicide rate for women drops by 20 if you have no fault divorce and we have multiple states in the U.S trying to move away from no fault divorce at the present um so I you know from this idea that that somehow men have the right to make reasonable discussions a reasonable arguments and debates and that other other non-men um don't I'm trying to avoid the binary language it's built into how we think about the west and how we think about this I mean you know especially the Germanic or the Latin languages all have their gendered um kind of holdovers and how we think about these things I'll try to do this I we'll just state it women are denied citizenship rights we as in general in the west reinforce gender binaries dividing people into opposing categories I don't think we need to to talk about that and then we frame them as oppositional male and female I don't know if I agree with any of this um not that we don't put people into opposing categories and not that we don't do big lumping uh things I just don't know where the boundary is so I don't like to think of them as as a binary as on off I like to think them as like spectrums or polls or ways of being and so it assigns characteristics and abilities and roles to those different spectrum's polls their oppositional mutually exclusive maybe um I think this is oversimplifying it um we'll talk about this a bit when we get to sex and sexuality I don't have any idea what people do with their junk and what it means back to that fundamental premise of polymorphously perverser we we have I mean I've done research a little bit of research on the men who have sex with men um specifically um in the relation of States using grinder to um Target men who have sex with men for violations of crimes in places like Egypt or whatever then it raised questions about the West having you know data controls so that places that have the capacity your phone gives away everything your phone is as close to your junk every day as anything is and it tracks you and tells you where you've been and tells you what you've done and so one of the problems for men who have sex with men is that it doesn't necessarily relate to their gender sexual identity hence the idea of the closet that that men can be straight and have sex with men and and men can do all sorts of things with other people and other ways in which they do things and it doesn't have any relationship to their Identity or their sexuality as they conceive of it right and so that's the point of denial and so coming back to this this idea of the social contract trying to Define what identities are and say that like you know marriage is the goal of identities doesn't make any sense historically or anything else it's very a very narrow specific post-war nuclear family view of how we think about gender identity and the relationship of identity to sexuality um bodies are constantly resisting this and this is largely a social story about how identities are formed through the nation-state it's the contract part of the social contract again it's fictional it's not based on historical evidence or practice or anything like that it's just based on these conceptual ideas that we've come up with in political theory that do this and so this this gender binary it doesn't really exist doesn't have any essential characteristics they're fluid they change back and forth they're they're asserted over and over again as mutually exclusive but they rarely hold bodies identify as much as they identify I went just looking at this okay most simple stupid framing from the argument we were having earlier about um what what is taking out the garbage right it's stupid social effectivity does it even need to be thought of in terms of gender I don't think so but it doesn't really tell us anything either because I went and looked up and I've seen this over and over again so this is from Reader's Digest I think the link is there if you click the image and then the PowerPoint um department stores jumped on board with Time Magazine showing this idea that there were sex appropriate colors again the language here is a mess um that uh boys should dress in pink um and that uh the color change was that that pink and blue for a certain time uh blue is for girls Penguins for boys then their argument is is that in the 1940s manufacturers went the opposite direction and decided pink was for girls and blue was for boys so okay I want to check this out right so this is where it's from this reader Sergeant so I go I look up Wikipedia Wikipedia is this entry despite popular belief uh including for various uh popular sources the reported pink blue reversal wherein the gendered associations were flipped during the 20th century most likely never occurred and is instead likely to have been a misunderstanding from early reporting Wikipedia has no sources here there's no discussion here is basically tell us about your high school's kids on the Wikipedia page deciding where gender is great what could go wrong um and so in a in 1927 a chart for Time Magazine reported a major number of department stores six said pink for boys and blue for girls four said the opposite so we never agreed on this at all um I went and looked this up academically so these are two sources in 2012 we have this discussion um was it a scientific urban legend that we coded gender with pink and blue and the binaries the first article talks about um yes it repeats the same idea that it's a myth then after publishing the article the author gets a bunch of feedback and it's like well let's look at this again so this in 2017 the last sentence of the 2017 article is clearly there's more than to pink and blue than meets the eye and a wealth of fascinating questions we have barely started to answer nobody has any idea about this stuff so the idea of producing gender binaries just because somebody tells somebody to take out the garbage ah sure maybe it's a gender binary I will go with somebody who is cited probably the most in all of social sciences uh Judith Butler the terms such as masculine amphemeral are notoriously interchangeable there are social histories for each term they change radically depending on geopolitical boundaries cultural constraints who's imagining them for what purpose that the terms recurs interesting enough but the recurrence doesn't index sameness doesn't even mean it's the same thing over space and time the way in which the social articulation of the term depends on its repetition constitutes one of the dimensions of ways in which genders performative it's it's I mean it's a great lie right oh I'm going to tell my wife listen we are bucking against the dominant Norm that men take out the garbage it's your job to take out the garbage like you know what I mean we can do whatever we want with this and play with it as much as we want terms of gender designation never settled and are constantly in the process of being remade yes I agree what's an example I'll give you an example this is the report from the arbor report in 2022 on the widespread and pervasive sexual misconduct in the Canadian military this follows the de Champs report in 2015. so this came out 2022. it's not that old um the reason that gender iframe as gender is a failure of identification why the binary doesn't hold is because again starting from my premise the gender is a present to all bodies Norms fail in bodies over time so even in then this is the case over and over with with militaries right they have a warrior masculine culture great except you get old your body fails you're no longer able to achieve that veterans by definition are aging out of that identity they get new identities so you try to make the veteran into a specific type of identity except the veterans from World War II veterans from Vietnam veterans from the Iraq War all have very different experiences based on the perception of society but their role in that conflict that but the ways in which society recognized that PTSD shell shock was the thing and that they made sure that those coming back from World War II had to spend six weeks getting reacclimatized whereas in the Vietnam War it was seen as a failure they threw them on the street we have a homeless problem all sorts of issues it's notorious that there's a popular correlation in the the kind of narrative public mindset about that that relationship between Veterans of the Vietnam War and so what we're talking about here is in groups and out groups always experience failure differently and it's their capacity to trick everybody into believing it that makes the binary function so here's an example this is from the report this is in Canadian military colleges Arbor report saying uh female Cadets were often told by their male peers that they were never going to be as good as them even when they were demonstratively so I don't know what to do with that information we can use the gender binary there facing the data and they're like we're still better than you so it's delusional right it's gender is of kind of delusion many resented having to trade in these groups clearly because if the female Cadets are doing as well as the male Cadets and they're still being told they're doing less well because they were demeaned at the slightest sign of difficulty or failure the dominant group though those who are identifying as men got to tell those who weren't identifying as the let's be clear these are the white men um that and let's they're bilingual white man because Quebec and and um uh Ontario is the dominant place where these groups came from the slightest difficulty failure the same is true for LGBT no that should be G that was my voice to speech kibets Cadets as the environment is prone to attribute and devalue some traits and celebrate the hypomasculine culture so what are we doing here masculinity then is a distortion of the dominant group to say that their attributes are better even when they're demonstratively not now the messed up part and this is what the arbor report function zone is that this produces culture this is a cultural problem this continues to cause major problems throughout the CAF the Canadian Armed Forces the staff of the athletic Wing were aware of these issues expressed concern and frustration at their inability to do more to address the problems so Educators in charge of military which you would assume is hierarchical where you could demand certain actions weren't able to address these deep-seated Notions about um about gender that they don't make sense so they can be a binary but they don't make sense bodies resist them they're not sensible even to those people experiencing them in real time and so the binary is just a story it denies it delegitimates and conceals the rights of people don't conform to it we have all of these different bills that try to say that this is is um that we can protect these rights they're constantly fought against there's stonewalling on gender identity and expression rights up to in the last this is the last decade this is your time um uh Canada tends to be deeply conservative in relation to sex sexuality and gender identity um this idea and we'll talk about this um of the personal being political but only in the public realm so we'll come back to this again and that the epistemology of the closet and this is the key Insight of of this is that the rational liberal male Western individual believes they choose the problem is and the key point the key critique of the epistemology of the closet is that when they are in the closet they believe that they are the identity that they're identifying with and when they're out of the closet they believe that that whole time that other person was wrong and then when they go back in the closet for whatever reason they believe that other person was wrong bodies are inconsistent in terms of their gender identity their sexuality and what they do even within the same meat Sac that we call a body and so this idea then of being morally panicked about about issues is that it's not the case so Chris moiser is a specific Advocate a competitive triathlete has been an Olympian and there is no moral Panic around Chris Mosier because it doesn't in any way challenge patriarchy because it's a trans man um and we get all the panic in the world um when it's trans women and so it's just not morally consistent and so the idea here of the the gender binary remaining powerful sure the textbook can say that I'm just not convinced um this remember the idea here is that there's more diversity but formal politics remains male cisgendered and heteronormative 100 look look here um the ways I express my gender identity it reinforces these things um the cisgender though is you from the Latin just means this side of which is the opposed to trans so with cisgender we're creating another binary right um across trans just means across from the other side of it means transition all the rest of it right um and so the key part then is the heteronormative part and this is what we're going to deal with over and over again is the normative back to the normative gender is normative sexuality is normative but bodies resist normativity um and so the problem here you know the 2021 election we have 30 percent of seats won by women and that's not great considering it's at least 50 of society in terms of equity but we also have in 2021 we've finally banned conversion theraport so this is not race this is not like a long-standing part this is very current stuff um and then we have eight MPS who are out and we have a two-spirit MP but the idea then that these are represent these representatives are representing our society is is not adequate to deal with the issues that we're facing in terms of this normativity um and so it comes back to these ideas about what representation we want how should representation happen and what does representation look like which is all about the internalization of institutional norms so it's not just that people will identify with whatever they identify with or they choose their identity no we we identify all the time with stuff that we barely know we're choosing we're not transparent to ourselves um and so we reproduce these these binary Norms these narratives but we have all sorts of examples of the ways in which this um is is internalized gender Norms are internalized they're not objective per se there are interpenetration of the objective and the subjective that produces weird outcomes the internalization of white supremacy misogyny and heteropatriarchy produces things like white women electing Trump right Trump has a casual attitude towards sexual assault gender-based violence could argue misogyny was part of his platform um 53 of white women elect Trump so they've identified in them either that race Trump's gender or that they would rather trust his going back his populism more so than perhaps their own identity right and so feminism is more than women it expresses this this claim for justice that that can or cannot be acknowledged and it involves people choosing their own oppressions right they do we could talk about maybe we'll talk about this idea of everybody's moms being into Fifty Shades of Gray there a couple years ago and the movies and the books and and just what are we doing like what's going on and so the internalization of Oppression produces the oppressor in all of us and we we are going to be doing it the question is we need to establish the buttress we have to buttress the rights against the ways in which we're going to choose normativity that's going to cause harm to ourselves and others that it's going to set standards so that we can be so delusional that we say that people aren't meeting the standards that we're not meeting them there are right that that level of delusion is part of how we think about gender
