 so land is integral to extractivism so your ability to um produce on the land uh I think only five percent of Canada's land is arable most of it's Southwestern Ontario and most of it's being covered with subdivisions um anyways so the removal of resources from the earth for profit which is resource rents or this idea that we can extract these things from it this possession and subordination of the environment to human exploitation game the Dominion of Canada playing on words bolstered by Terror nullus European entitlement rise of capitalism sure um and so extractivism then is the idea of although these forestry mining oil and gas drilling and fracking um fracking uh especially under Obama became so widespread that it became in the first time in American history where they started export oil because they had so much oil that they were getting from fracking uh they have damaged I I don't think you even just need to say indigenous at this point I mean global climate change they've indigenous land food chains and ecosystems um and they destroy not only land but relationships cultures and way of life but if you've I mean we can do this with the tailing pawns from bitumen extraction um even if we deal with everything else they still haven't found sufficient ways to get rid of uh the tailings and what we call tailings is in order to extract bitumen they have to inject large amounts of slurry water with um some other chemicals in order to get the oil extracted from the land but the runoff of that it creates these really toxic pools these ponds that we're not sure how to get rid of it's not quite like nuclear waste because it doesn't have the half-life but it also isn't a solvable problem as easily and so resource extraction problems are this constant source of conflict between indigenous peoples in the Canadian State primarily because I pulled this from the TSX owns website the TSX fully recognizes that 40 of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX Canada is the center of this there is now a growing uh scholarship about Canada's kind of extractivist imperialism around the world because we are the mining company the mining companies are is all Incorporated in Canada why because they have the history and experience of establishing these huge foundations and what's the quickest way to make money find something that doesn't have any cost or a limited cost versus what you can sell it for right and so this is the way in which we do it and these are these are some of the examples of the tailing ponds I don't want to get too much into the Alberta situation is much more complex it's similar to what Saudi Arabia is doing Saudi Arabia is now siphoning off money it gets from oil in order to put it into green energy so they can be carbon neutral Alberta's done a fair amount of recovery from strip mining in order to reproduce the lands and and all the rest of that that's not to say that it's not carbon neutral and that's not to say that it doesn't create other problems but I'm I'm hesitant to to do too much what I will say about extractivism is it provides all sorts of resources right of wealth if you want to look at the largest oil and gas companies I have a friend he's written extensively about this two biggest by market capitalization sectors of the economy in the world are Banking and resource extraction extraction sectors oil and gas Saudi armico Saudi armaco which is doing all that Sports washing by buying up literal sports leagues and sports like Golf and paying for them through the fact that it has these ability to extract huge rents um from energy and oil production so this is a the market cap of these largest oil and gas companies I googled this it took two seconds this isn't hidden information oilprice.com has great information why because extractivism needs to know about all aspects of politics in order to better understand where we're going how we're going and then make money off are they going up or going down so you know we're talking about a market cap of Six Trillion dollars comes from the resource sector it's a highly valuable important sector of the world um and in terms of this the reason why and reason why it's increased in so much significance and importance I just picked you could pick this at any time I just picked I went to our world in data and just picked from the 1930s rather than from 1800s to show even since the 1960s the amount of energy so that's energy that we have tracked extracted from resources and you will look at I mean coal has gone down a bit um there's no economy in the world that's that's off of oil there are green economies that have transitioned to other forms but their cars still run on gasoline and that we don't have enough and this is the next extractive thing the uh the valuable minerals that go into batteries are now the new source of extractivism so even if we shift off the CO2 producing stuff we're still going to participate in extractivism just different forms of extractivism which are going to pull out different things but in terms of this oil gas and natural gas we are still what is called a petroculture civilization I have a chapter in a book on petroculture civilization that that is what we're based on and then we can look at they just blur a can of the us together in terms of CO2 production and then look at sub-Saharan Africa where you simply just don't have it so what we get then as an extractivist economy absolutely is willing to recognize and perhaps even share in the extractivism but extractivism has to continue and so the reason that we're trying to deal with these issues and why we're doing land acknowledgments why the course outline has this at the beginning why we do these intercourse other way we say these things is because we are trying to get to a place where everybody agrees that extractivism should more fairly share the benefits but they're rarely a critique of extractivism itself because 40 of the world's mining companies are in the TSX it's directly linked to the Canadian economy and what the Canadian economy means so we've had efforts in the past to try and fix this problem that these treaties exist Pierre Trudeau uh attempted to do this with a white paper in 1969 thought assimilation was the answer and then it just basically resulted in resistance and mobilization this is what I'm saying I don't really think this is about indigenous identity this this weird this chapter because we're talking about top-down issues right so I just went to Gord Hill so Gord Hill has this book it's comic book I've used in the past um it it exists out there there are copies of it and what he's doing is saying that okay instead of doing the top down framing I'm going to make a comic book to show what it actually looks like and so I didn't I don't want to steal all of his copyright here I want to reference it um and he just documents this this kind of History he went through and documented all the history from um 1942 frameda's Invasion uh Howard zinn's of people's History of the United States if you ever wanted to see how I can't even I can talk about it it will make me too upset to talk about um Columbus's practices of Slaughter and all the rest of that you just go look at the data yourself and I I'm not going to do it it's upsetting to me um and so it's there but it's an invasion part two is framed as a resistance the Inca Insurgency from 1500s to 1780 the uh mapuche um the southern Chile that resisted today the 1680 Pueblo Pueblo Revolt the Pontiac Rebellion if you don't know about these things um listen I don't either I just read the comic book um this is what I'm saying about the kind of the white washing in a literal sense of History because we just jumped to the post-war in this chapter right um I just went through he's got the Seminole Wars uh the Apaches framed as gorillas of the Southwest the war on the plains the war on the coast I cut it off but the um the symbol of the uh the Seattle Seahawks its indigeneity is a long history and tradition about this this fight on the war on the coast no justice on Stolen land assimilation 63 68 Rebellion 68 was a year of worldwide Global protests particularly of students but of also against communism against capitalism it was everywhere and it was also in the Indigenous communities which led to the American Indian movement we have Wounded Knee the Oka crisis the zapatistas this is a 1995 standoff we have 1994 there's Stony Point in relation to Western just down the road from us and then Caledonia is there as well and so Gord Hill is trying to frame this as whoa we have never agreed to Canada we have never agreed to settlement we have constantly fought against settlement and these some of these he documents that British Columbia unseated territories some have just never been seated there's never been a treaty that's covered it we never said it's okay and yet you're still continuing to do it or the treaties have designated the territories and we're defending our rights under those territories and so this idea of developing this indigenous resistance to colonization of the Americas beginning with a Spanish Invasion all the way up to 6 Reclamation of land in 2006 and then Caledonia as well which I would actually was at Caledonia a couple times and this framing of this long tradition I mean I just typed into Shawnee on Tick Tock and this is the first one that came up this idea of invasion as present ation people are here so I mean this idea then of these is specifically this is the six nations in the city around Mohawk I went to high school in Hagersville which literally is on the six Nation reserves the railroad tracks cuts off the the hegersville from the reserve it's literally the other side of the tracks but all of these communities as this is where we are we're very close to all these this is the GTA these communities have been here and have always been here and continue to participate here um this is the the Haldeman tract um that was originally designated as part of the treaty and then the reserve that is on the track near Brantford and so this is very close to London here these are are clear and then the wet sweating which the the textbook talks about I'll talk about we'll bring in a bit is is being tied together and so this is just a map we have these ways on Google Maps now this is the wet sweat and protest sets off a series of blockades of Railways across Canada because wet sweating is this um this um I think I've got it in here maybe it's a bit later maybe I should just skip to it now uh yeah so this is it here is that these Coastal link pipelines are having to go these are all the different indigenous communities they go through or the Trans Mountain pipeline which is explicitly designed to kind of cut through between the territories see it goes right along the boundary lines of different treaties with the wet sweating one the only way to go is go straight through and so as a consequence of that it started these these um these protests that are across the whole country and so it's framing very much this idea of there's the the territory um the ways in which they're the the pipeline is going through the territory and so the argument from gordhill for example is that this is just a long part of uh what we've been doing this whole time we're always protesting and resisting these forms of extractivism um and that this has been constant and ongoing so we get these weird kind of framings of things as being post-war their mobilization is post War when in fact it goes longer than that we have very few formal political organizations because of resources prior to that the white paper sets off all of these rebellions that it unites all of these groups in opposition so it's the practices of the federal government that generate specific targeted responses from communities that have been resisting all this time um you know we have this case in 73 that establishes no no there are collective rights and so the UN drip is so integral because it is the establishment of the fact that these communities have been fighting for rights recognized rights rights for their Community their Nation their peoples um all along and it takes us until the 2010s before we're actually willing to sign a non-binding agreement that recognizes those rights so this isn't in the past this is in your lifetime right this is presentism like we are in the present and so part of the what the white paper triggered was also the effort to try to to deal with all of the problems built into the Constitution about how funding and consultation happens um there's all the problems about how this happens in the 1995 we've got this idea of self-government coming from these territorial claims these building of legal cases and responsibility abilities to doing this and this idea of incentivizing is extinguishment of Rights um we have indigenous leaders coming together defending the Constitution we have continuous kind of efforts against um Golf Course expansion and we could talk about the ecological viability of golf courses in let's say Las Vegas and then we have arrests and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal peoples is produced in 1995 which is a 4 000 page document which clearly outlines the problems and issues which I mean just people don't read right um and so I'll get to this in a bit but we have this in 2000s we have the establishment of of none of it which was largely framed as the conflation of the Inuit with indigenous communities we have Caledonia the opp we have national days of action we have the missing and murdered indigenous women and we have all of these efforts to to establish this tradition this framework of it's not a contemporary issue it's always been an issue it's always going to be an issue it's going to continue which is why reconciliation comes in and we'll talk about this as a way we can't avoid the issue anymore so we have to start dealing with the issue so how do we deal with the issue I've got um uh issues uh you know what let's do it right now I'll just do it now instead because it's good I'll show it twice hello hello first I'd like to remind everyone here to turn off your cell phones before we begin this evening's performance we would like to acknowledge that this theater stands on territory of the initial Bay hold nashoni the Huron wendat and the platoon First Nations we are also mindful of broken covenants and the need to make right with all our relations and now please enjoy the show oh ah sorry hello excuse me um should we um should we go excuse me oh no no I just mean if we're on someone else's land shouldn't we shouldn't we leave oh no no no the the theater is here now we just like to acknowledge whose land it is I'm sorry I'm so confused so if we're on someone else's land shouldn't uh hopefully we'll enjoy the performance oh okay so some of the the money from the ticket sales of the show are going to the indigenous communities well no a portion of them no no the the ticket sales go to the theater so is the money from the bottled water sold here going to the First Nations for clean drinking water or oh no that money goes to Nestle their sponsor I'm so sorry I'm so confused so who's whose land are we on what are we what are we doing it's a dialogue um how are we making right well there's a uh there's there's a plaque you can read in the lobby I'm just I don't understand I'm getting a message from the stage manager that we need to begin the show so please take your seats have a good time but um good night I guess I'll sit down enjoy the show so I think that's an apt representation of the idea of the kind of continuous recognition or non-recognition why does this take so long why are these not set up because we just keep moving on because we can frame present and past as a binary thing and so why don't you just get over the past rather than seeing the ways in which the past is in the present and this legal fiction of recognizing what is already legal without actually resulting in political change is kind of the central problem of recognition
