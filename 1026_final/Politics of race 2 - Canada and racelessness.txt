 so the textbook starts by Framing this great social transformation I mean I I don't know how you can assess great from inside great and I don't know how you assess it's new this idea of hyper diversity in urban centers I mean Constantinople like that this has been historically the case of urban centers have always been a place of convergence um and connection so the politics of Sidious assassin talks about the politics of cities in this long tradition of cities being sites of kind of different types of politics that you'll find elsewhere um and so we get then this majority minority um framing of issues um this kind of multiplicity of of racialized minorities constituting a majority of population I don't why I characterize this is so what they're trying to say here is more than 50 percent of people are becoming the that the groups of uh communities that have been traditionally marginalized or in the context of Canada have represented less than 50 percent of the population are now more than 50 percent of the population in other words the idea that the minority is the majority I don't think that that's how race functions it's not a numbers game it never has been hence Colonial India um it's been about hierarchies and power and the capacity to enforce minority uh a rule as if it's majority majoritarian sensibility so that's the settlement of Canada right settlers coming in and not having a numbers game but still claiming that indigenous communities don't have the right to representation under our social contract right um but there is and I I do think there should be and there has been a lot a series of long-standing critiques about multiculturalism going back to the discussion we had about the idea of Tolerance from roles for the liberal notion of Tolerance under pins multiculturalism so it has been criticized from left and right that the idea of Tolerance and multiculturalism doesn't actually result in a substantive engagement with those communities and what it does is it tolerates them and tolerance is supposed to breed the idea that we're going to get along but without engaging with those communities you're just kind of creating enclaves and you don't get a substantive agreement with it and what this does is produce in-group and out group dynamics so if the majority group or the one group is refusing to engage with the experiences of another group how is that resulting in some type of better understanding it can often just breed resentment and so it doesn't necessarily result in the idea of liberal progress right and so I'm not really sure we need any of this but it's this um this is the absent subject positioning of this chapter in other words Canadians the subtext of this chapter is Canadians are white now that Canadians are having to deal with the race let's deal with white anxieties as if that should be our primary concern right this generating anxieties and backlash listen whiteness has always been a source of anxiety for um people when they have to think about themselves as race when white people have to think about themselves as race it causes anger fear or aggression towards the notion of of that somehow their hierarchy and privilege isn't natural right it's always produces so we get white lash white rage all this these conspiracy theories about replacement stuff I'm just going to debunk those before we even go further I don't know why they platformed this I said I'm not sure why they platformed this I I just added this to the text in order to show that um all this replacement nonsense doesn't have anything to do with anything in that the idea that there's a population some type of population correlation to race or how we think about race we throw out a 1.3 billion of tons of food a year around the world uh a third of the food that we make just goes straight in the garbage which is to say that this is not about resources or the lack of capacity data resources even if we were a little bit more efficient with our food waste we would have more than enough capabilities for things to go around um you know the discussion about housing and stuff like that at the post-war era remember the the marginal tax rate on the richest was like 90 percent and there was a massive expansion of public subsidies into housing for War veterans so we created housing um by the government in order to provide resources for those people and so if the government chooses to build houses for people people have houses if we decide in the 1980s that the private Market is more efficient at allocating these resources we are going to have the provision of a tighter Supply in order to get a higher level of Demand right again those are aren't natural they're created by decisions the government doesn't intervene in order to create houses we have uh slower responses to this we don't have those resources we we don't get access to the spaces that people need to live right in terms of population and and population doubling it has gone up but it is decreasing and it has decreased so for a long time our our doubling time um when we went 10 000 BC was was very low by 2000 it had reached a kind of peak that we would double our population within 51 years but by 2025 we're seeing this decrease again and this specifically has to do with this idea of population growth as being somehow correlated to how we can think about things I had it last time right we could have billions and billions of people on the planet it's about the allocation of resources and the types of lifestyles in which they live and so this idea about fear about which population is growing or not growing or things like that there don't have anything to do we know the top 10 percent consume 90 of the resources that distribution problems have more to do with anything than than population population doesn't matter all of this comes from malthusian and Neo malthusian are arguments this idea of an imminent disaster that's being predicted about population has been predicted since 1798 emerges around the idea of the concept of race right the idea that there's certain communities that are growing faster than other communities and therefore that causes an imbalance again back to this idea that there should be a proper distribution but we have no idea what that is and so this idea that our population is growing too too fast or that we shouldn't have anything to do it that that somehow there's a fear here we've seen efforts to undertake efforts to control population so 38 of the global population is in China and India so if we want to talk about population control or ways in which we can think about which populations are growing which ones aren't both of these governments undertook around similar times efforts to control their population in India it was education so it was this idea of educating the poor that here's you know access to contraception and iuds um it didn't have any substantial impact on the society cultural attitudes and opinions impact how we think about production and and social reproduction so um you know this idea of children per woman from 1956 to 2000 was um the same but life expectancy um uh decreased over that same period so we didn't see a substantive change in um the idea of the reproduction of that this idea of uh the reproduction of the population it didn't substantively change whereas China actually did have substantive control they have a strong centralized authoritarian government they're in able to implement the one child policy and so they dropped from a 2.2 percent growth rate in 1970 to a less than one percent in 2000. this has become an issue the the one child policy was dropped because there's Now 50 million uh single males in Chinese society and the population is shrinking and so you can't have a growing economy with a shrinking population which is exactly what we see in the the west and this tension between how do we grow and not have these issues and so they implemented controls and they were successful but we don't know which one's more beneficial because now China's got this problem of they've removed this policy because they need this again and so this idea of how a population grows I mean an easy way that the Canada can grow its population is just double the number triple quadruple the number of immigrants we let in but then majoritarian sensibilities get you get bounced up against right um and so when we think about carrying capacity there's very little evidence of any specific amount of people that any country or place can have it has to do with the efficient allocation of resources and how we Define efficiency if everybody wants to have chicken we're not going to have an efficient allocation of resources that's just how it is and so why we perpetually have these debates about a replacement or population or all the rest of this in the context of race is it's a form of of in-group out-group sensibility if you you believe your population is good you're going to believe that the source of ills comes from another population Malthus was really concerned with there was too many poor people it wasn't that there were too many people it was there were too many poor people and so this is this is also what Foucault talks about with the emergence of the concept of race that as a categorization race was also meant to apply to lower classes and so the fear isn't just about the you know the phenotypical characteristics the skin characteristics of who's growing it's about the idea that they're not growing in the ways that we want right and so this goes back to the idea of improvement and development about who gets to decide who grows and how they grow they were he was mad that poor people had too many kids and they wanted to take their money away Galton said you know this struggle for uh existence this fear of overpopulation of the planet Marx just to argued it was a distribution problem and this goes to the fundamental question is what is the right level of population on the planet this is a famous quote from a political scientist who is like he he goes to um India and he says oh there's people and you eating washing and sleeping in public and there's people people as you move through their mob would we ever know all three of us were frightened and ever since that I've known the fear of population but as somebody else pointed out if you were in Times Square or New York or Piccadilly Circus in London since around this time like from the 1800s on since the enclosure movement on you would have seen this exact same circumstance but when people fear overpopulation they do it through racially coded lenses there's no way to think about what Society should look like without making a series of claims about your in-group position and the out group position and how they should be and so we'll see this over and over again we're seeing it in the current moment and we're seeing it specifically in relationship to the idea that and this goes back this is literally eco-fascism and this goes back to the Nazis and remember the Nazis board a lot of the Eugenics programs from America with that developed those in relationship to its long history of the plantation economy and so the idea here is that there was this fear that too many people would be um take up the living space or they were a threat to the culture and environment that in 1935 Germany first passed its conservation laws as well as a push for organic farming this idea that that in Nazi Germany this idea of the rapid urbanization and environmental degradation was a problem for Rural populations and that this was used in in the um the framework of the Charlottesville riots and that this is what this book is arguing as well is that we've got and there it is there in 2004 this is my quote that I pulled a group of Dutch authors recorded the estimates from 94 scientists what's the carrying capacity of the earth it ranges anywhere from 500 million to one sextillion 21 zeros there there's it just depends on how we organize our society about how many people can live in theory we've got the Sun and we've got it providing energy with us so if we really drop our energy consumptions and make sure we focus on the most efficient form of consumption we can have at you know that's what I mean one sextillion there is no scientific foundation for how many people we can have on the planet but what we're hearing over and over again in the context of global climate change is this idea then that somehow some groups are going to be responsible for the problems and other groups are going to respond to those problems and so that's really what we're getting at today is this in-group out group dynamics about what the actual problems are and how they are framed through ideas of race and specifically we're going to deal with these two questions one is there a distinctive Canadian politics of race racism and racialization and how as political science engage with the race question spoiler alert not well that we haven't really dealt with this um substantively and so the idea of of this persistent denial of it as even a subject is one of the primary problems that we have in political scientists I see it constantly this is a kind of constant an issue where people just simply think well my issue doesn't have anything to do with race it can't that just doesn't make any sense right it's not a sensible way it's the denial of the existence of race and the den this myth that Canada has a raceless past and so um specifically in in how we frame things this is the idea of the linking this back to specific liberal framings of the absent subject so I want to be one who respects human rights and everybody's specific experience and so I do that by saying I don't see race that I simply don't see it and the absurdity of that is that you do you absolutely do you participate in it and you normalize your through your white salafism these ways in which majoritarian sensibilities um permeate how we think about all aspects of things how we think about systemic racism as being something that exists or we deny it the institutional racism exist or we deny it the ways in which we've constructed things like I give a rant about pants the white uh Western experience of the idea that the business suit is a thing that we should all do and that the gray drab business suit is something that I participate in that I'm forced to participate into in order to attain respect and authority and that as a consequence of that then I participate my own oppression I hate pants and I can't do anything about it and and so this idea then about who's just great like there's no color it's just so boring right it's so boring and yet it's it's a tacit Norm right so that's a stupid absurd example of the kinds of ways in which these majoritarian sensibilities are perpetuated by everybody that we participate in them and they're culturally specific right like there's lots of different historical experiences about this but I can show you the G20 meetings G8 meetings about what they're wearing over and over again that Fashion Is perpetuated by this kind of weird domination of what should be and so supposed incompatibility of different cultural Traditions are framed then in terms of kind of a ideal or non-ideal superiority okay I'm going to stop here because it's likely I'll get a copyright strike on this video so I just I don't want to lose all the rest of the discussion we'll jump right into this idea of not seeing race
