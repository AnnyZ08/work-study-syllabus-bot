 um so I I just want to Define these terms because I included these terms and they weren't included in the original reading because as I said I don't know why we would start with a kind of derogatory concept to talk about how we shouldn't be derogatory um and so this is the human rights office they talk a lot again the the framing of this textbook has been about framing from the global to the the local and trying to bypass the state or use the global to criticize the local I think because it's doing this rhetorical argument about um we shouldn't leave things up to individual states we should all collectively agree on on what is going on so there's a human rights office talking about ableism what is ableism discrimination based on a value system that considers certain body and mind characteristics essential to living a fulfilling life and assumes that the quality of life of people with disabilities must be very low in ableism like in racism homophobia and other forms of Oppression dominant social groups project their own image as the model for how Humanity should be rejecting or ignoring others as inferior not normal or unfit this bias is used to justify their exclusion sometimes even their extermination one example is the Eugenics movement which emerged in the early 20th century and resulted in the force sterilization of more than 60 000 women men and children with disabilities under the pretext of improving Humanity's gene pool in Nazi Germany more than 300 000 persons with disabilities were exterminated because their lives were considered unworthy but despite the scale of these atrocities ableism continues to spread and its significance remains little understood ableist social views still shape our understanding of what it means to live with disabilities and how the lives of people with disabilities are valued thousands of women and girls continue to be sterilized against their will and many more persons with disabilities spend their lives confined in institutions prisons or at home and deemed to be incapable of living in the community ableism underpins the way our societies are organized basic daily activities such as going to school or work taking public transport doing groceries or practicing a hobby are made difficult if not impossible for persons with disabilities and end up excluded and isolated human rights Challenge ableism and other forms of Oppression and fight for a world where diversity is valued and embraced humanity is always changing people everywhere use their minds and bodies in different ways and those differences are what makes us stronger human diversity is all around us we are all part of it let's embrace it [Music] I mean okay but do you see how and so I think this textbook does what what this this does too we have no specifics here um we have specifics of harm but we don't have people here we have literal blobs um because this Fabian socialism of the UN Human Rights office as the textbook clearly points out wants to individuate the problem and say the problem is both individual and systemic but provides no Solutions no ways in which it gets worse no ways in which it gets better we just point to extremes like Nazi Germany as a foundation for don't do this but it doesn't provide an argument for why this is happening the ways it's perpetuated and let's be clear the UN is just as as responsible for this type of stuff as anybody else um so this idea then in the general comment number eight in the rights of persons with disabilities describes ableism as a value system that considers certain typical characteristics that bind a body of mind is essential for living a life of value based on strict standards functioning Behavior or appearance ableist ways of thinking contribute to disability as a misfortune that leads to human suffering this adversely affects opportunities for work employment and just living life right um so one of the ways I thought this was an interesting way to do it is to talk about the ways with a more concrete form like with actual humans you know um again human actual people let's do people um because this allows us to to at least see some people and the ways in which we're comfortable and uncomfortable with this and so we I showed this in my class last term and we had some problems with this too about the ways that it it reinforces ability and disability but it's at least a specific campaign so this is ageism as a form of ableism it's a substance so what's this all about okay [Laughter] I'm too old for this you just want me to say what people say about me weird question I guess my teacher says yoga out of it it's just a phase it was never a face I never grew out of it I guess I'm too Reckless I don't know people like to talk very loudly to me they say I don't think things through you're looking still good for your age I'll figure it out when I'm older you are having a senior moment [Music] it feels like I'm not given a chance I need to keep up oh get out of the way I lack experience or too much experience I'm baggage only weighing people down looking at my age like it is a disease where I work no one takes me serious it makes me powerless when people see only my age [Music] so I think everyone short of Immortals has age and so we do normalize our experience of our age both in how we relate to others who we see as as the same age and those that we see as different from the age that we expect them to be which is the ways in just this normalcy just reproduces itself on steroids all the time because everybody's subject position then makes them a little bit prejudiced towards everybody else's subject position so it's it's it's it's not going to be resolved right something like this will not be resolved because people are going to pattern recognition you know we learn through repetition and if we repeat ourselves with the same experience over and over again then we get a new experiences it's shocking to us but we do have to at least think the politics of this right thinking the politics of this is the beginning of thinking about what rights do we need to set how do we need to frame these things and how do we need to distinguish between actions that are causing harm and actions that we need to be responsible for um so it there's no resolution here um I think it's very clear about that in the reading but that this is the beginning of thinking of a politics this is how politics emerges
