 okay everyone welcome to the discussion of gender and genders and sexuality um you know this is I've been arguing throughout the course so far that um I where is this where is it where is it why isn't it been here what's going on why why don't we have this more um I the textbook is doing a couple things that I want to talk about I'm doing a couple things that we want to talk about um this is one of those weird discussions of identity that that becomes both static and Abstract that needs a grounding over and over again um and so I've got a lot of memes in here and I'm doing a glossary again only because I don't know like I don't know what people's level of comfort is with these ideas they're changing all the time I go back and look at my lectures from a couple years ago they've changed the language has changed what I can borrow has changed how we think about these things stuff changes and so that's just how it is um you know I used to not get this and then I kind of got this and then I didn't think it was good and then now I actually think I kind of agree with this um in a weird way and so I'm not sure that we'll all get the same logic in that the idea of of having a space that the social facticity of of identity right people need to perform bodily functions and is society going to allow them to do so seems like a pretty basic thing that you shouldn't need a lot of politics to figure out but increasingly these are deeply political issues and so we're talking about what we're going to do today um this is is the structure of the textbook and I'm going to kind of put my own stuff on it I think that's the value added right and it's your value attitude you have to figure out what you want to accept and what you want to reject and what your commitments are and what they are like I can't try to indoctrinate you on this stuff and I'm not interested in doing that I'm interested in articulating what the textbook's saying kind of some of the things that I think and I'm research and then you have to figure out what it is that you understand from this stuff and so in the abstract the textbook is doing this move in the abstract to try to make it as abstract as possible I think to avoid the kind of the personal is political which seems counterintuitive anyways so we're going to talk about the Canadian State the ways in which the Canadian state is implicated in this in what the textbook calls this hetero patriarchal which I'll unpack I mean it's not even a concept that you know I'm quite comfortable with gender Concepts my dissertation and my PhD dealt with masculinities and gender it's not that it's just that the terminology is weird sometimes terminology changes and it brings in new stuff and doesn't so we'll talk about challenges to the binary division of the public uh and the political and the private and the domestic which I think it's a Perpetual issue when I teach international law it's a massive issue just about like the role of the state and when we're talking about Warfare and then what what takes place on the battlefield and what's a violation of of Law and rule of law and rights and all of those things they're all bound up in this um we'll certainly talk about feminist queer racialized indigenous Advocates have have resisted these types of discriminations and then how you would apply these approaches and I I don't think I can think of myself without applying these approaches that that men in masculinities um you know settler attitudes my sense of self are all bound up in what others think and how they think about those things um stuff like this right the ways in which we can do this I do think there is a need to to think concretely um think through these ideas and think through the joking saying what can't be said and what a joke kind of adequately does and so when we think about these things there's a there's a bunch of um these questions it's weird because these questions I I you know I'm going through the textbook the same way you are each chapter is is new to me each chapter has different authors in case you haven't noticed so sometimes the authors repeat each other and there's a little bit of tension between the chapters too so some of these questions you know what is political that's what we've been asking since the beginning and you have to have some sense of what that is you should have some sense of what that is just in your own in order to make sense of the world around us right who's allowed to participate who's allowed to speak and and what do they represent when they speak um where does politics occur and then who deserves rights and then how are rights achieved I would guess we would say because I don't like the idea of granting rights and I don't I do like the idea of taking rights but they have to be taken from something or from some system of adjudication and so these have been clearly persistent themes of these interventions but it is weird that we haven't talked about this stuff kind of substantively when we're thinking about this I've tried to do that throughout um the identities in chapters six through ten that's the focus of all these different things so we're going to deal with with ableism and and um we're we've already dealt with indigeneity and we're dealing with uh we dealt with race and now we're dealing with gender and so we'll go through these as we go how to think about this um so to make it clear everybody has their own biases these are my biases they don't mean I can't judge things and that I can't recognize that my biases influence my analysis what we do when we foreground our biases is say this is how we come to things so if you're trying to figure out why it is that I'm saying what I'm saying it's because of these now there's going to be ways which I can't foresee that this is happening but this there's something one I just think gender is oppressive and Regulatory to bodies in the glossary we'll have this discussion I've been showing an Oprah clip a very old Oprah clip for a very long time um just talking about intersex bodies in the way in which gender gender Norms try to reshape those bodies in a literal medical sense with with surgery into types of gender normativity and they just resist it um we resist this on every level we can get into this I've written about this in sport and the ioc in the past in the ways in which bodies once we start to dig into to what barteries are we try to do type things like chromosomes and we try to deal with gametes and stuff like this it gets really messy really quick which is to say that gender is also a limitation of technology and design I don't know if it's appropriate or not but certainly with the Advent of of augmented reality it's easier than ever for people for me if I put a filter onto switch gender identification um only online so if we're able to take that into our personal lives how does that happen and I've got some clips again in the glossary dealing with this in relation to to botched into two spirit identities and the idea that people can people have and always have move between genders had different understandings of gender and a lot of that has to do with how we are capable of fulfilling their societal needs in our current societal makeup which is a technology and design function like bodies queer is an inherently anti-normative concept it doesn't have a set meaning it's resistant to Norms and as a consequence of that then it reflects this idea and this goes back this little old old idea of the idea that bodies are polymorphously perverse which is they don't tell us anything about how we enjoy or desire those things are always constructed in this inter-subjective relationship between how I feel and what I'm capable of feeling it and and whether or not that Society can even provide the the space for me to feel those ways and so um we're thinking about this um you know identities only make sense in the practice like the subreddit needs to be there in order to understand kind of contemporary manifestations of white subtle male North American identity um not entirely not exhaustively and not completely in its oppressive to somebody's to frame it that way but it's also reflects a certain normativity that comes out in that normativity is something we can constantly resist but we constantly do right the oppressor and all of us um there is an interesting sleight of hand trick in this chapter which I don't disagree with I just don't know if they should if you should have to make your method explicit and so in this case the method is we aren't going to discuss identity we're going to talk about rights and so the right space model is okay they problematize this near the end of the chapter as if somehow Liberation is the same as like marriage rights which for many communities it doesn't even make sense right that's not a sensible way to thing frame things so what we what we do then is we just assume all these identities exist and we assume that everybody understands what they are which is okay but it's a bit of um I don't know what do you call the liberal elitism assuming that because I know something you should know it too I I don't think that's true I think people are everybody's capable of understanding these things but I'm not sure that assuming everybody knows these things isn't a way that'll make people feel dumb right if you don't know what what you're talking about and so framing these issues in terms of Rights then is just saying well why doesn't this group have these rights yet but for some people they might not have an experience with that group and might not understand what it is or how those rights are being articulated or what they look like right um so so this is a bit of an inherently Fabian framing we want to achieve these rights for these communities so we're just going to assume everybody knows who those communities are and what they're arguing for and now we'll just talk about the right space Framing and so weirdly in this chapter we're talking about all these identities we never really get a sense of who is speaking or why they're speaking and so we talk about lots of important identities Throughout the chapter but we don't really talk about the I guess we kind of talk about the way they're impressed they're oppressed but we don't have any subjects doing the oppression or if we do we're being very late about it because we don't want to offend anybody um and so this is what I I don't have any sense I don't you know I have to pre-record these lectures and then we'll do it in person and while I have to gauge it it's feedback right there's there's only one way we'll talk about this but the ways that the the um the shadow archive or what we talk the hidden curriculum right the hidden curriculum is a thing that we can talk about the ways in which kind of social attitudes get conveyed in the way that we don't say things and the ways in which we assume other people uh understand things so that's why I put the glossary in I don't know who the glossary is for I'm not sure what the glossary is doing I've got a video in a minute that talks about the problems of definitions so this isn't a dictionary definition and these aren't I don't provide definitions that you should memorize what I'm doing is providing a provocation an example a tick tock that provides an example which then I try to back up with some type of academic literature I actually thought I should be showing you how I find them it's Google Scholar and then it's keyword variation until they get something that approximates the argument that's taking place in the video or supports it or estab publishes its foundation in academic literature um and so you know how do we think about this and then how do we think about it and this will be a kind of central question about homo and heterosocial organization the ways in which kind of Western thought creates binaries and then it frames everything in oppositions um the other thing that will come out through here is is the hidden right the what is Cedric calls the epistemology of the closet the idea that that certain groups can't see and that people aren't even transparent to themselves let's be clear people are trans be transparent to themselves because it requires them to understand themselves in ways in which they don't um so there's a lot of denial I've got a whole bunch of memes in here about just um uh sexual Erasure so dominant groups just erase the existence of other groups in real time and so this is an example of that I'm sure I'm bisexual uh Marnie Simpson I have no idea who these people are it doesn't matter um hence hints at sexuality she's sure they say hints after admitting she kisses more girls than boys and then the sub might think she's like it's the obviously tweeting something they're sure about but then the community they're receiving Community says well we're not sure about that um which is all about normativity and so this is the often used example but it's interesting to think about about um how the example always is is that left-handed there's some left-handed people have always exist but societies when they're trying to mass educate and the history of most of these societies has been to design to think and to exist as if everyone is right-handed now some of those societies have taken up this cause and tried to rethink how we think about normativity and design and outcomes this does cause like injuries and death as a relationship of not being able to reach the thing quick enough or respond to the situation quick enough um but it's this idea that um I don't know if Lefty Frets is a good source of data for statistica to use but sure whatever it's just the this idea that if this is happening with regularity if it happens with a human regularity whatever the hell human means um why is it so different based on the community in which you're in and why are there places we would assume that are more conscious of more understanding of difference that are able to accommodate the difference and then what's happening in places with strong authoritarian systems where they don't right or they don't think about this difference that's really what we're talking about here this is the one that's used all the time that's the Washington Post just the history of left-handedness from 1880 to 1900 to 1920 and then it stabilizes so that is to say and this is the whole point of a lot of these discussions is statistically we could be at a period where there's going to be a certain regularity and with two-spirit we know that people have had non-stable gender identities before Western Civilization could be called civilization and so as a consequence of that then that means that we probably had a level of gender identity whatever you want to call people existing and then Society tries to minimize those number of people existing and then we decide at some point well we'll try to change our social norms so that we allow and then it stabilizes and so this question of of what is a norm and who creates norms and what Norms means the Assumption here is that there's always going to be a certain level I don't know that that's the case but we can assume that this is just the idea of um how we have as a society reinforced patterns of behavior breeding food all the rest of it to produce different types of bodies over time in the bodies of chickens because we want to eat them billions of them a year remember 70 billion I think we need two chickens for every person on the planet anyways um and so this idea too would be more than that anyways um the idea here that that what is normal is always going to be socially constructed and it's not going to be the same over time and so the idea of normalcy or the constitution of what a problem requires a society to exist and so we don't really have a sense of normalcy until mathematicians get obsessed with the idea of a distribution of gaussian distribution a curve the bell curve and that that is supposed to be the ideal again because you know in political science we're obsessed with ideals I guess there's some type of platonic ideal or in this case an analytical ideal something we can mathematically Force bodies into as if forcing those bodies into produces this and then Notions of this and this we've been dealing with this all along the idea of progress right do we think something is Progressive or not what does that mean what would it look like and so the whole idea of of this is as Queer as as anti-normative or non-normative is a as a framework that is intentionally ambivalent resisting a monolithic definition understanding your specific characterization of it identity took this from from Cedric in 1993 and referenced 15 000 times and so what we're trying to deal with here is I've been talking about how long is this intersectional kind of framing of feminist Theory how all of these come together the the idea of gender class and racial oppression in the construction is a hierarchy and power how gender and sexuality are differently constructed regulated on the basis of these identities um we'll come to these over and over again but the black and racialized women in the feminist movement who are rendered invisible Kimberly cramshaw who who was just a legal scholar coming up with the idea that if you were I talked about it before but if you were um black you would make claims as from the uh make a legal claim from a black community if you were women you make legal claims from a women Community but we had no framework to how you would make claims with both of those and the more that their overlapping forms of Oppression the harder it is to do these things and so where we come to understand gendered social learning I don't know I don't know where it happens I don't know where you think your gendered social learning happens I'm not sure how you think about Identity or how your identity is um formed about about is it something that comes from the home is it something that comes from socialization with friends is something that happens in the school is it something that happens in public is it private is gender is sexuality how are they how are they relation how are they reinforced how are they discouraged the social facticity of things and so that's this is the example I've got it in here um we'll talk about this just one of the ideas of social effect is if you have an idea of someone's job to take out the garbage right I think I've got it right here actually let me show it oh my goodness oh I didn't show it here I don't have it um anyways I I will pause here and then have to bring it back together so this is The Tick Tock that deals with um the social facticity of of this and so blue bins are a blue job the gender normativity of of how we do those questions should be dealt with by the people who have to deal with those questions and so this is one of those weird situations where it's not at all clear that that's the case um and that it's not at all clear how that normativity comes about or if that person just chooses to make that decision or if they make that decision because their parents did it they make the decision because they as a in a relationship have decided they as a in a couple have decided that one of them is going to do those jobs and then is going to assign them to some type of role as all forms of social factitity of gender and so when we think about these things this idea then that there if we're dealing with intersectionality we should be focusing on the ways in which intersectionality of gender is oppressive in ways that multiplies those oppressions in order to impede Justice right that under this that under patriarchy um the pervasiveness of intersectionality means that sexuality and gender are going to have a very specific way of simultaneous oppression that is neither racial nor solely sexual that's in 1974 right this idea and so the idea that these are new issues doesn't make any sense at all the idea that we'd have these debates today doesn't make any sense at all because these things have been happening for as long as things have been happening we can deal with this idea of of you know they deal with it specifically sexuality and gender in the Canadian context um there's a great book on this that I teach in my other classes on the Canadian war on queers which is the purging of lgbtq people from Canadian Public Service in the military throughout the Cold War and as they argue in the text it's not because the Americans require us to do it it's because we choose to do it as Canadians the Canadian nationality serves as the foundation of doing things like developing a fruit machine which you attach to genitals to see if they get a biophysical response from showing pornography to people as as if this is a real thing it's a it it's dystopian in it it's absurdity and so this idea of of the the politicians who have to come out and fight against being characterized as criminal because they are gay in the Canadian war and queer they famously talk about how the idea that there was this this decorated war hero um who uh we like embodied masculinity and just was in no way closeted and was strong and clear and a great uh military and he was still kicked out because he was gay because it was seen as somehow insufficient or not part of the body politic but he never hit it and he did nothing um to ever make it any reason for him to be kicked out of than it being his identity that's Trudeau senior there at a gay protest there's a link there if you want into the the history of this um and so part of the problem is that I think some of the debates that we have about gender and sexuality aren't based in data um so this we had this from the Census in 2021 the number of people I was trying to figure statistically this is insignificant right we're talking like point three percent of the Canadian population and not significant in any statistical way like even if you go City by city in Canada this is less than .08 percent of the population 75 percent of the Canadian population lives in these colored areas so in that club in that quarter in Southwestern Ontario and Quebec that little part around Calgary and that little green spot in Vancouver so statistically whatever happens there matters more than the rest of Canada just by sheer numbers so statistically this is totally insignificant people are really bad at assessing groups based on media so this is American estimates you can pull this up it's um I think this is yougov just talking about how how America Americans estimate so they estimate the number of the population with income over 1 million uh dollars they Americans think it's 20 it's not statistically it's it's less than one percent so it's zero um the the idea of trans or trans identity is 20 it's it's one like barely around one um our indigenous uh 27 it's it's one um live in New York City 30 it's three um the let's do our member of a union 35 percent it's four uh are vegan or vegetarian it's 30 it it's uh five um voted in the 2020 election that's one thing they got right 60 um and then all of these other things are are overestimated and underestimated right and so this is this issue when we're dealing with things like um uh the rights relating to these communities why they're being targeted um for regression so taking away rights or taking away the access the ability to access things is this this problem of numbers American adults are now choose that group to attack and I go back to what LBJ said a long time ago and he said if you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man he won't notice you're picking his pocket hell give him somebody to look down on and he'll empty his pockets for you only one and so that's very similar to what Dubois said this is another thing talking about statistics intersex is not an anomaly yet it only accounts for 1.7 percent of the population on the high end of this is a weird argument to me is me 0.0006 of the global population lives in Ireland but we all agree that people live in Ireland four percent of the population has green eyes but green is a natural eye color 1.5 percent of the population are redheads but red hair is a natural hair color but the 1.7 percent of intersex population is where you suddenly consider biology and deformity yeah let's all keep pretending that gender isn't a social construct the intersex is not and then this is just Bomani Jones talking about this this problem making something out of of literal statistical props at school from being a dude and saying that you are a girl so that you can go dominate at sports you're not even from that we have here is a group of people who have an argument that they get treated worse than anybody else in our society and definitely at the greatest risk of somebody killing you for no goddamn reason in this society and to gen up outrage toward those people we have manufactured an issue which is they want to come play sports and the problem just doesn't it the problem just simply doesn't exist right so I don't even go further beyond that point when it comes up is there's no there there in this I think it's in Kentucky where they passed a bill that applied to literally one person so passing bills that apply to one person is is nonsense so the reason that I have such a strong reaction to these these type of debates is because I've been through this because I took my degree and I was getting my degree when 9 11 happened and then we had to deal with what we've statistically studied now is the billions and billions of dollars put into stopping something that didn't effectively stop anything um in terms of this so this is a new form of moral Panic if you just look at the return on the investment like the amount put in versus the number of events that were prevented and so it's it's all framed in terms of these these weird metaphors all the time about this but but realistically this goes back and I talked about this before and I'll talk about it again um is the ways in which we frame uh the idea of using a speech act to securitize something so the idea here is that what we're actually securitizing is statistically not significant if you're passing a law for one person it undermines the idea that we're all the same under the law and it also undermines the idea that the law is impartial right and so what this really reflects then is a moral Panic it's these these ideas they're by Design you can do this and we've done this over and over again in political science we've dealt with the issues of terrorism how all of the stress tests and all the mechanisms that we put on the systems put in place to stop terrorism don't pass any threshold of Effectiveness they just don't um and so what happens then is that we just we pick up this idea of the you know what's the problem or how this is they're not randomly selected if we typically pick marginalized groups as cultural scapegoats even when the vast majority are Law Abiding and even when many of majority are not in in the dominant group we just tend to do this uh out of proportion with the actual threat um and then we just fight about whether the extent to which this is a risk we want to do risk there's great political science stuff done on insurance and risk uh we can go into that it's a very interesting topic this just doesn't have anything to do with that um it's not statistically significant
