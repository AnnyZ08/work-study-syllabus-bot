 so we've largely talked about gender to this point um but we can talk about this idea of the sexual contract um we understand how the positionality of of bodies again this is so binary um bodies that resist binary classifications uh the political system is based upon gendered and sexual relationships through the idea of establishing women often married women having citizenship rights and property rights because they're married and so women couldn't be citizens on their own or access their rights on their own without the privilege of marriage and this is still there today it exists today we have all sorts of ways in which compensation taxation attitudes opinions legal rights are different if you are in heterosexual relationships versus other forms of relationships the idea then is that we have used marriage as the framework of understanding because it has ties to religious sensibilities as the framework of co-opting um Alternative forms organizing your social life and we have differential regulation of of the private so this is the public private split and so marriages is the idea of of the legitimate form of lgbtq Rights comes through marriage and marriage rights which doesn't make a ton of sense because there's lots of rights that fall outside of that and that what I'm talking about here is that we've seen this we've seen this in places like Russia pushing back the idea of domestic violence gender-based violence violence against women in the home as being domestic and therefore not of scrutiny by the state whereas for indigenous communities we still have all of these efforts to take babies away literally immediately after birth from their mothers um it's still it's still an issue it's still a Perpetual issue so we're willing to go and do that for marginalized communities but we're not even willing to look inside the communities in rich areas I mean I've we have friends who are police officers and and she has mentioned the ways in which um there are places that they never get calls to or if they get calls to there's going to be so many mechanisms before they get calls that would lawyers and all the rest of it would make it very difficult to even investigate those types of issues and so the sexual contract then depends on and reinforces hetero patriarchy this idea of patriarchy combined with Notions of heterobonding that reinforce legal cultural and political attitudes towards what is the dominant form of social organization I'm not saying it's a dominant form of social organization because we know at this point it's really not statistically it's not even dumb that we're moving away from that um that the you know um life expectancy of women shoots up after their husbands die that we have lots of examples of um now people not getting cohabitating without being married and we have children being born and raised outside of traditional forms not even tradition Western forms of heteroseocial relationships right um I wanted to do a a Venn diagram of the ways in which rationality gender and this is the lagunas and towards the decolonial gender the way in which Humanity Madness colonizer colonized and then colonized man colonized women and then two-spirit indigenous non-rational and other bodies fit outside but it would just take too long and it's there anyway this is the idea of intersectionality the overlapping Venn diagrams of who counts and how they count and the ways in which they're represented or non-represented in the system the the kind of the stupid debates that happen from people um you know the the literal president of the international genetics Federation being told he doesn't know what he's talking about because somebody on the internet believes otherwise and so this idea of telling bodies what they should be doing you know it's it's kind of built into the premise of dominant social organizations the ways in which we produce gender binaries heteropatriarchy and sexual uh contracts as ways in which we produce settler colonialism um two-spirit is a catch-all term from LGBT uh Q conference in Winnipeg in the 1990s I've got data here um specifically they're at least 168 indigenous languages in the U.S alone that describe um two-spirit people so two-spirit is another word that doesn't really mean anything it's just like the dominant group trying to come up with something to address the fact that it hasn't even started to understand what the problem is indigenous peoples labeled as inferior and civilized because they didn't adhere to these settler beliefs and Indigenous women's rights were actually undermined by Western Notions of of uh political representation and rights because we go back to the traditional status of the the Longhouse the hot dinner the the women and the elders had a very specific role in political organization which they were kicked out of and so the denial of matrilineal material linearity that should be matrilineality um indigenous women's property rights and two-spirit people I mean genetically we should always Trace through the women's side but we do it through the men's because patriarchy um and then we've disrupted the structures the cultures and the strength of indigenous communities um there's this continuous and massive misreading ignorance and imposition of values as natural how about Canada um there's a government Canada website they used to do at one of those you know Heritage minutes back in the day talking about how the name Canada is a fundamental misrecognition of uh karchay and his understanding when people told him hey that's the village down there he's like nah that's this whole place it's Canada and they're like no no that's the village he didn't understand and so now we have our country name based on a misunderstanding um and that this idea then of that we had this um this idea of supra binary genders I like that idea that they can do either that they're super um that they're better than our genders because they get to move around and they get to be different and they don't conform to standards um was framed by anthropologists who encountered indigenous communities as they use the word beardic you don't have to get into it too much here but it's um it was a form of prisoners used for sex purposes um and so even the language that we have like two Spirits better than that but it's still not great and so we're barely scratching the surface of of how naming and the ability to name these problems is still so much bound up in dominant groups that we can't articulate even the beginnings of what some type of freedom from these these Concepts would look like
