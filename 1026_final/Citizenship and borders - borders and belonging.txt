 so the externalization of borders takes a bunch of different forms um Visa policies which countries you require visa from and which ones you don't it's a way of discouraging travel discouraging those groups from um participating just doing tourism visiting um it's a form of remote control right in managing movement from a distance so temporary foreign workers so when we have uh when we want home care we open up Visa offices in places like the Philippines or um anywhere in I think it's Malaysia as well we open those up and make it easier for people to access we also designate certain areas safe and not safe which then means that and this is the there's a whole bunch of Contra services around safe third parties but the idea that if you're coming from a place that we have designated safe then for example you your um claimed to be a refugee is going to be harder to to make right um and so this idea of you know putting visa requirements on some people means they can't so freely freely travel um this idea of saying that you're from a safe country therefore we're not going to even process your um Refugee claim or we're going to say you have to process in the place that you first encountered so one of the controversies about the safe third party agreement was Canada the U.S entered into this agreement that said that you have to if you're applying for Refugee status make the application the country you first encounter or whatever it was um but that included like flights so if you flew through Atlanta over the U.S that would be the place you have to do your your application even if you arrive in Canada and so that you would be rejected and you'd be told you have to go apply you have to go to the border and you have to apply in the U.S and so this idea of push bodies around is this a way in which you can externalize the borders you don't actually have to deal with your border because you've had agreement with another state that they're going to tell that person that they have to go somewhere else to deal with the problem right um and so when we think about these things all states do this I don't want to just uh level some groups out we can talk about Trudeau and the Syrian refugee crisis the targeting of women and children which in theory is great but in practice you're doing the thing again right like you're you're designating which bodies get to to literally live and die based on Notions about what you think looks appropriate as if that the status of the people who need the protection has to do with only their now it's not to say there aren't differential impacts of fighting and conflict especially on uh women and children and minority groups not the case but the idea of us designating which groups are are to be chosen for protection is weird right it's it's weird it involves this it's it's the height of privilege is able to do that um and so in terms of the adjudication of these issues many of these issues fall to the executive which is the and we'll get into this later in the course uh we'll get into this with um the executive I.E the president of the Prime Minister because traditionally Foreign Relations deal with one leader to another the the rule of Kings right Kings enter into agreements with one another so what this means is that the executive has wide Authority and latitude in making decisions that impact things that are outside of your country now not your citizens your citizens have rights but decisions you make that impact your non-citizens totally within the purview so the interesting part let's say it's interesting for sake of benefit um the interesting part about Trump's ban on Nationals from muslim-majority countries remember you also called Haiti a country um direct quote um was the idea and he removed the temporary protected status for Haitians that's what he he was doing when he was complaining about that the classic way in which the U.S has opposed communism in Cuba has been the wet foot dry foot policy so if you are a Cuban who hits American Shores you have one foot that's wet one foot that's dry you get status you get some form of status will give you protection you can come here it's a strategy against the other those other places it was also extended to Haiti especially post earthquake but the idea of this temporary protected status for Haitians was what Trump was rebelling against when he said these things but because he said those things is the only reason that he wasn't able to pass his his uh his literal Muslim ban um the Supreme Court ruled that if not for his statements that were overtly showing the intent was not to pick the countries but the people he would have been able to pass it the executive has that authority to do so it can absolutely designate countries as threats or not threats to National Security but because Trump had had said publicly that he wanted to ban them because they were Muslim not because they were the states he wasn't able to and do that and so there are some mechanisms that can constrain what the executive can do in relation to other people's bodies but not a ton because it's up to the individual state to protect their citizens and it's not up to me as a state to predict you see how it's it really becomes citizen Foreigner citizen Foreigner right um it really reinforces so borders are not disappearing globalization did not bring the end to borders they're just being refashioned in new ways so we're just thinking of ways of doing them differently new agreements new ways that we either push or indicate that we're being tough on things so we get less Refugee claims you move down your your ranking in terms of the best places to live you get less applications those types of things and so this idea is very much citizenship and borders are still very much defined by the territorial sovereign state they involve this form of untaxed inheritance by which you get based on where you were born which is very hard to move you if you are lucky enough to have a state that recognizes the blood Quantum of a grandparent you can have it conferred through you but all of this stuff about blood and whose blood is it's weird there's a weird blood politics around citizenship I didn't really get to talk about um and so you understand it though right like they did this notion of certain States establishing that you are one of us because of X Y or Z or not one of us because of X Y or Z and so globalization in migration are forcing us to think about these in new ways I'll probably try to find a tick tock dealing with the idea of climate refugees because climate refugees are going to end up with uh stateless people who don't have a state because it's literally underwater so this raises interesting questions can you be a citizen of a state that doesn't exist you can get digital citizenship in Estonia because Estonia does all this cool cyber stuff you can apply for digital citizenship so you can run businesses and have your place of citizenship be Estonia doesn't really Grant the same stuff though there are other states though if you have like 250 000 in cash you can come in right now and buy a property and live there right so there are all ways in which we can think about who has access and how and then what that means so I don't know what it means to be a citizen of a state that doesn't exist but we are increasingly going to move to that and we're going to have to say do other states have an obligation because micro States and small island States certainly did not contribute to global climate change they are going to Bear the brunt of it and the question becomes what happens to those bodies and who's responsible for those Buddies the current system we have right now says they're foreigners and so it's up to the state to be responsible for them even if it's underwater oh good times because nobody wants to touch the regime and the the regimes that we have in place have defined citizenship and still leave all the power and capacity to the state and we're not interested we have obligations we have legal obligations that we have to enforce through our States but we don't have legal obligations to do anything then adjudicate whether or not somebody's claim is valid and it was ruled by a one of the human rights councils that somebody's claim I think it was towards New Zealand I can't remember the reference right now um the idea that um uh climate change had resulted in a change of livelihood which was a threat as a justification to apply for Refugee status is not immediate enough and so at some point it will be immediate but right now it's not and because it's not right now we don't consider that status as a well-founded fear of persecution which could make you a refugee because you're not being persecuted you're just dying um and so this produces these weird political nature of borders I don't think covet did I'm pretty sure 911 had something to do with that um I think Daniel Dracut you work at a book out just before 9 11 that said the end of borders right globalization of the under borders and then oops um and so this idea then of having things I'm not even talking about though is but temporary migrant workers I mean particularly with covid uh we're we're stuck in quarters and work in close circumstances where it's very difficult um to not get coveted and so they were considered essential I guess because you don't want your crops to rot but at the same time didn't have the same protections we would Grant or the same recognition we Grant to others um so yeah borders closed uh to travel but not to trade well in some ways yes in some ways no part of the supply chain Mix-Ups that were happening was because we were sending empty cargo containers back and full ones in those type of problems that come from that and so um that's just to say that when we're thinking about these they're deeply political they go to the core about who belongs and who doesn't and then how you decide who should belong and who doesn't
