 so this inevitably becomes a question and this is to follow from last time I don't have an answer um in terms of green we probably want everything to be as green as possible um and as quick as possible in terms of of addressing energy concerns and climate change concerns um but then we produce all of these other issues but do we have access do we have ways in which we accommodate do we have you know basic things that you can do it as simple as like places for people to breastfeed um do we produce those do we have things that people can have Braille access that doesn't say like there's a whole bunch of those subreddits about like something in Braille just says put this in Braille or um the ways in which you have closed captioning I mean I I don't know my daughter wants everything with closed captioning she's 15. um and so this idea of of access for different types of abilities is always going to be there as I talked about in the lecture this idea of restrooms being out of order or not having access or not building public restrooms or ways in which people do it so people who are going to need to use restrooms have to do it in a private way the ways in which um all of these impact the ability to to travel as I talked about in the last uh video so this idea then of of functioning normally is just coded in this language right about how things should happen and who they should happen for um the inadequacy of public infrastructure is a constant issue I have some data on that as well um the public-private partnership is perceived of as the way to innovate now we can use these simple and ridiculous example of sports stadiums the idea that the public should put in money for sports stadiums because there is I don't know Prestige and benefit that everyone gets to experience when you go to a stadium therefore we should give public money to private actors who get to reap it is still a thing we do um and so disability is not framed as a larger social problem and the lack of public infrastructure is not referenced I went um to the this is policy options website just to see um some data I was trying to find metadata on infrastructure I've got a bit about the US very little about Canada we have under the last government taken up this idea of infrastructure the U.S is in the opposite position where their infrastructure is crumbling it was designed to be like 50 years old just falling apart there's a whole book there's a now every military when you commission something you have to do Rust analysis because for years and years and years people designed everything and didn't do any analysis about the rusting and when you're spending 800 billion dollars a year and you're not thinking about how infrastructure falls apart it's as important to think about how Things Fall Apart as they work when they work best right we like to idealize right we like to think of the perfect scenario and go from there so on the Paul when I looked up infrastructure on policy options it was all related to ageism and elderly and our aging population I was going to show that graph right it used to be that like we had a big young population and a small old population now it's kind of like a silo all the way up and so this idea then that more and more people are going to require that infrastructure this is just I just pulled this it circulated a lot it's Doug Henwood did this you know whatever he's left he posted it in um it's a bunch of Lefty places it doesn't matter the date is the data right uh this is just net civilian fixed interest investment in the public sector as a percentage of GDP I could not find this data for Canada I looked for it I was on statscan I was looking over I couldn't find it um all I got is the the investment in total amount which doesn't tell us anything in terms of GDP um I could do it but it's just I don't think it's worth it this is the argument we are especially in the west investing Less in infrastructure over time in part because the cost in part because of what was in that video and as this average per the decades this idea of moving towards market-based provision so we don't need a NASA to produce a public good of a space shuttle we can pay the private sector to do it and they get the benefit of profit as well and so this is as close as I could find this is a little bit dated but there is an interesting argument that's happening here is that as we have shifted politically away from the idea that we um the government should be basically doing what a mortgage does right the government should take out debt in order to to um um allow you to build a bigger house or build infrastructure build other Assets in 1955 the idea of the federal government taking a role in these issues was uh key it was kind of split between the the federal the provinces and the municipal level by 2013 we see that the federal government is now down to 15 the provinces and the municipal is taking over half so you'll see a lot of the Innovations in terms of parks and development and accessibility and infrastructure is happening in the municipal space in part because Municipal governments don't have parties right Municipal governments are too small and too local for that they also have direct access to a tax base and you don't really have a mechanism to vote a party out at the federal level you can scream and scream and scream every time one of these governments gets elected on a tax issue and so when we do that all of them are more hesitant to use federal level taxes to do these things it erodes federalism in general forces everything to the provinces and the municipalities and means that infrastructure is going to be more and more idiosyncratic right you're not going to have the canada-wide infrastructure that would establish baselines in key sectors or ways of doing things you have everything shifting to the provincial and Municipal level and even the provincial over that period has gone down not as much but it has gone down and so as a spending of GDP this is the I could find it was 2013. this idea is that it's been somewhat steady but it's dropped from six percent to three percent and so this idea about who should do this and how we should do this is also about who who should build infrastructure and who they should build it for and I it depends on your community I guess which is a messed up way to think about rights that increasingly Canada has moved to a framework that says it's up to your community to decide whether or not you're going to do these assessments you're going to build the infrastructure that is is doing these things now you can pass laws provincially which we've done you can pass laws federally that require things but the cost is still going to be done at those levels and the decision making is going to be largely related to those costs and so instead of thinking about expanding the public goods because they benefit everyone publicly we're increasingly thinking about well we don't want to spend that money and we're only going to build infrastructure locally right we're not going to establish ways in which it's easy for us to like China get from one high speed part of the country to another so they don't rely on cars we don't do any of that and that the ableism environment doesn't it's not just about um being different and causing danger it's that we don't feel safe because of it right it's because you don't have you know that when you go out there's a risk that that thing's not going to work or there's not going to be something there it increases your risks and so the decisions we make in infrastructure and design result in differential risk and that differential risk is just people calculator right um and so it's this framing of the absent subject as if you aren't going to need care and you aren't going to need concern and you aren't going to need to think about these things and so this framing of disability as the status quo is really this remedy poison scapegoat this view of of the disabled as the source of their problems it bleeds into how we think about things it bleeds into framings that are normal I have I can't even show it anymore I used to show it in my social movements class it's a letter that was sent by a woman in Kingston Ontario I'm going to say in 2015 2016 not a long time ago just a horrific letter basically arguing for eugenics um because they have somebody they're they're I don't know their kid and their Senator I don't know um it was um autistic um and it's just a horrible thing I won't even platform it anymore but this is all of it is framed into terms of normal normal normal it's all through the letter it's the idea of normal remember normal didn't exist as a concept um until like basically the 1800s and so prior to that time like people had all sorts of weird stuff nobody looked what was inside your pants and nobody cared about how you were differently abled it was the idea that like you know we should try to assist and we should try to help because you know people people and so this idea of how we think about these things um you know what we're doing then is when we're serving the government is increasing the idea of what are the categories and then saying well these are issues of concerns we're adopting the the UN model right look at these problems that exist why don't you guys deal with it rather than saying that it's a federal or provincial responsibility to deal with these things and so it gets pushed to the municipal level we're identifying ever more forms of disability um as if the identification is the same as doing something and then as a scapegoat it is is used for a term of problems we wouldn't want to address we we frame everything and oh that's too expensive or that's to this as if we don't get the benefit from those things and that we aren't moving towards all of us I mean in some way in case someone's figured out a way around linear time we're all moving towards needing more of these resources over time um and that there yeah I won't even say those words but this idea I mean there's a reappropriation of of of there has been a reappropriation of that um but I I you know I'm not interested in those but this way is in which not that I'm not interested I'm not interested in doing that work um and so uh this idea then is that there are some reappropriation but the language you use matters right because it frames how we think about these issues um this idea is that politics then about these contested claims is always going to be making decisions on where resources go right resources in terms of just I'm going to fix my language or not right um disability is still largely outside of how we think about politics because we're thinking from the center what affects the most people the most rather than thinking about what affects everyone and how can we everyone benefit so we don't frame it in those terms I'm not making Socialist Communist arguments there I'm talking about benefit in terms of well-being right um and then this idea of um how does disability Force like addiction Force us to either you can be sympathetic or critical right fall into the idea that well it's their problem and therefore I shouldn't have to deal with it and this you know this exclusion um if we thought about it as kind of the status quo of experience rather than as individuated problems we'd probably be able to address these things more adequately we need to kind of re think how we frame different ability that's why I focused on ableism we need to challenge the categorizations about conditions about status and stop using human as the referent use capabilities recognize that our physical and social environment reproduces status quo and it reproduces attitudes about government in the way that we do government and then rethink how we think about ability and and enabling more ability in everyday life not modern I don't think we need that um and so yeah that's the end of uh those discussions again I think we need a glossary here um I just haven't developed it as much as I've developed the other one so I've got a thousand Tick Tock saved um and so uh not all of them are about that but they will be over time
