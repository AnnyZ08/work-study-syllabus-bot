 okay um so this is our chapter on um on ableism and disability I added the ableism stuff because there's a bunch of things in this chapter um that we can talk about as we go through um it has a specific theoretical underpinning that it's not um talking about I'm also curious about the absence subject here um uh so my mother is legally blind um but the reason I had filmed like this is because I have an issue um I just wondered there's doesn't seem to be a lot of like voice so I think there's a glossary needed for this week too I just don't think I have enough assembled yet which also speaks to the ways in which kind of the amplification of voices happen we're talking about voices today as well okay so the learning objectives so we'll we'll frame ability disability as individual and and non-political demonstrate the way in which disability is expressed as a form of public policy has negative consequence negative consequences um I would frame this as just for all of us like rights right if one group is being actively suppressed marginalized or unable to articulate themselves that's probably as much on us as it is on them and so this chapter introduces this idea of the the pharmacon um it's an interesting concept it largely comes from uh dareda derida's reading of this term and a specific reading that he does so Jack derida famous philosopher of deconstruction I mean lots of insights on the ways in which Things Fall Apart and so he kind of rereads the concept of Farrakhan against the idea of remedy of poison as also as a scapegoat as as this way in which we can get around having to deal with things or put it on somebody else so we don't have to deal with it um and so we'll explain how Transportation policy does this I also kind of want to talk a bit about infrastructure this is the shortest chapter so it gives me a little more space to add some stuff and then we're going to discuss ways in which ableism might be uh reconceptualized and re-engaged in politics and public policy and explore how political science can unveil the illusion of inclusion that's a lot of alliteration um by critically engaging in the term I I that's why I would like ableism I don't the the discs I've got it in here I think it stems from a specific tradition that we probably want to be conscious of um the ways in which we produce certain ways of understanding and being um so yeah there's there's a lot of stuff bound up in here um I'm gonna talk a bit about normalcy as I have all the way throughout um I I don't you know this comes from my own literature so I've written on Norms um specifically on Norm confusion um and the idea that a norm doesn't really make sense it is sense making but it doesn't make sense it's it's specific it's contingent it's historical it's it's what happens at a specific point in time so um the idea of disability then is really about the production of a concept of what it means to be normal and then using that concept to police others as we've talked about through um you know there's an assumption of this something like that the individual is not set up to deal with as well and again the individual here is is an absence subject the individual is always one that is doesn't have specific characteristics and so everybody is like I'm hard-pressed to think one of you or me or anyone will not have problems walking later in life in which case there are going to be things that cause impediments to that and the question is are we doing it for for individuals we perceive as needing it or does it benefit everybody to have that right so and so this separation from the normal um yeah this idea of distribution we've talked about this before in the context of gender it's very similar um you know the politics and governance of of ability and and disability preserves the status quo um securing some at the expense of others yeah sure okay that's fine um I will say this is my addition to this the concept of normalcy largely comes out of the modern the high modern ideology of the experience of Western Enlightenment um ideas about the state can do more than just tax and raise militaries it can regulate and so part of what that comes out of is is science and medicine wants to discover um how bodies function as we talked about last time they become obsessed with what's in our pants they also become obsessed with like is there Universal characteristics so one of the ways in which we get to this idea of normalcy is all of these different iterations that science went through to try to figure out if there was something that we could could figure out if people were the same and different so the way we figure out um and so there's a bunch of ways it does this it like I said it's the bell curve the normal distribution and so it's trying to cover the bulk of the people the bulk of the time which produces the idea of normalcy um you know even Marxism has is the rest on the aggregation of working bodies the premise of the labor theory of value that everything produced in the world comes from labor and and its capitalism that ex alienates us from our own labor and allows some to exploit us and get rich while the rest of us work ourselves um endlessly and so the norm then all it does is is the concept of normativity um comes out of this idea of this normal distribution that somehow that there's a normal distribution and I've got examples here that we'll talk about in a minute of efforts to find what is normal and then creation of deviance outliers aberrations and so the discs of disability is really about this idea of framing as lack thereof and so it individuates the opposite to the this dominant and this far away from as in discarded and so it's got all of these ways in which it reproduces normalcy in the concept um this is a famous article that deals with um the this effort to develop what what binds everybody together primarily as a mechanism of policing and control so the state had this problem in that prior to the discovery of something that could let us track people um it was pretty easy to commit a crime uh in one area and just move to another um you just change your name the state doesn't really have any way to regulate you this is prior to to well I mean how would you do it right we barely have photography so what the state started doing is trying to develop different things trying to categorize people through this normal distribution of let's take pictures or or images of those that are um in the society who aren't criminals and those in the society that are are criminals and say what lumps them together and so this is what is normal people who don't commit crimes and do things and this is what is deviant everything else so um and we were trying to do this in order to track right to track criminals and track them down and we do this today with DNA testing and never give your DNA to a private DNA company because in the case of Dallas they use the stuff from 23andMe to do broad sweeps of genetic material anyways back in the day they took pictures of ears they thought ears were unique and that they could figure if they could figure out a way to take a picture of everybody's ears they'd have a database of ears because they even have images and they have database you can watch old episodes of Law and Order like prior to the internet um you would have to look through literal photographs of of um criminals because you wouldn't have any way to identify the mix-up through sight and so they tried this eventually they got to fingerprints which are assumed to be unique but in practice haven't been one of the um suspects of a Spanish Subway bombing was picked up in the middle of I think was like Idaho or something had never left the U.S just happened to have this fingerprints it's as much art as science in terms of doing this and so where we get normal from is these early statisticians trying to figure out how we categorize society and um you know emerging from those people that were assumed remember there isn't this idea of social Mobility per se a lot of these legacies that we've talked about of back to Aristotle of different categories of people are different categories of people they're not the same things we don't have a kind of conception of humans per se we have classes right and so back to last week and the week before this idea of race and and reason is what establishes some groups from others the poor laws that I talked about before and so as a at the concept of a social whole or a society then produces well if this is a fixed number let's see what the distribution is in that number and we'll get to this next week if we don't have borders it's much harder for us to make those claims and so we have to be able to define a community and then see the distribution in that community and the Assumption here is and it's a Eugenics assumption is that there is always the same distribution this gaussian distribution of people's capabilities and characteristics and so Alexander Graham Bell feared that people who were deaf would breed with breed look at everything would um would have children with other people with the same characteristics and create this this this race using that word race of deaf people um and so now Cochlear implants has been a big controversy because it has a language and community and culture that technology wants to remove and so it's it's been a big thing I'm I'm not wading into that mess it's a it's a very interesting discussion I'm just not going to get into in here um and Emma Goldman the anarchist famously said that birth control was needed to prevent poppers syphilitic epileptics alcoholics that word criminals and degenerates so this idea of the lower classes of the lower races was just a broad sweeping characterization um built into the premise of of how we think about things those kind of markers of of Canadian iconography at Brantford um has him all over the place as as this was supposed to be and so the reason that we did it this way was it is easy to lump all the problems of society into these groups right and to blame all the problems of society into these groups there's a reason that this eugenesis stuff goes on steroids with the Nazis right all of these ideas um were perceived of that we still don't like let's be clear we still don't have adequate mechanisms to deal with addiction as a society we are not designed to deal with addiction it is not at all clear and we've got like 150 years of it that um are mechanisms of addiction treatment are more effective in one form or another everything from cold turkey through full rehab their effectiveness levels vary um and there is an argument a political argument that it's not about about curing addiction it's about treating addiction so people can leave normal lives right say we don't get rid of those addictions like we've got a whole society set up around alcohol addiction as if it's normal right um it's just produced we know that it has negative consequences but we've decided to decide we're going to organize things we're going to regulate it but we're not going to you know prohibit it per se some people still believe that some people want to do that there's but I mean we just went through the prohibitionist regime around cannabis right and there will there will be moral panics over and over again about this idea so a lot of state fairs then we still have Ontario fall fairs um have these competitions that do this to this day think about like when you go to a if you do it's the whitest thing ever if you go to a fair listen London Ontario's had problems with with race and racism at their farmers markets Farmers Market says sites of whiteness or a big problem um but if you go to a Fall Fair they have competitions for like the prettiest whatever right the aesthetically pleasing whatever which means that like for example carrots um for the longest time like 40 to what is it 30 to 40 of all carrots were thrown in the garbage because they didn't look pretty um it took somebody in California to realize you could make baby carrots uh in order to utilize something we were throwing out because it didn't look pretty fall fairs like they grade the prettiest or the best looking of each type of thing everything from cookies to pies to vegetables whatever and it's still based in this idea that if there's a normal distribution let's find the best right let's find the top of that curve so who's the fittest families what are the intelligence tests uh the Gerber baby was effectively a eugenicist idea of creating the perfect at in terms of aesthetic baby um then journal Nature approved the Nazi use of eugenics for sterilizing um Madame Bovary was you know the height of the populist novel in modernity it was thoroughly anti-semitic and eugenic and so the our spaces reproduce normalcy all the time which then says this is what belongs and this is what doesn't and the university classroom does this like everywhere else um there are all sorts of ways I minimized it here you can click the link but the language I'm going to commit these problems we're still going to put these problems the Washington racial slurs the football team in Washington up till 2020 was using an explicit racist slur as its mascot and everybody said well because they do it you know why can't I what's the big deal well because you shouldn't be doing it right um and so we do this all the time although these languages there's no way for me to to say that without producing the problem but we have all sorts of ableist language all over how we talk all the time um and so we have Expressions euphemisms sayings that are just bound up in this that are caught up in the way that we think and they produce like all these micro harms like it hurts people when you say those things doesn't hurt the group saying it um and it might not be the primary concern of those other people because they deal with it so often but it's still an issue these were the you know the these are the states in the U.S in 1935 that were still doing um uh eugenic sterilization um all over the place in terms of the numbers um uh so this is not this is less than 100 years ago we're still doing and as I've mentioned before with indigenous communities we're still doing it we're just doing it I guess not systemically though it's happening systemically it's not being ordered but it's still being done anyways um so one of the issues that comes out then is the language we use and how we think about what the production is this is actually from a student at Western in 2014 who encountered Prejudice from her Prof in a classroom um about this idea of of having an identity that that that Prof didn't want to deal with the interesting part about this response was that um there is a strategy an explicit strategy of just silence of dealing with silence so this is always the danger of me doing uh video lectures is that we don't actually have any feedback mechanisms and that we're both silent um I think we've understood that the being in person helps but being in person also produces a bunch of uh Notions about normalcy ability in agency that the premise of Universal Design and this really reinforced it for me the part of the reason that we in this course do things the way we do is because we are moving towards Universal Design the textbook has audio outputs it has ways to do this now there's all sorts of problems with that but we'll get into it um and so when we think about questions of who speaks and how they speak and who can speak we like to think about them as being reasonable well it's unreasonable that I change my language because everybody uses that word it's unreasonable that I do this or that and normally what reason means is that it's an in-group saying that an out group doesn't have the right to tell them what The Thinker do or say right but that reason itself is normally bounded it's bounded by the dominance the attitudes the opinions the efficiency whatever it is whatever word you use to do this and then this idea that stems from that is that if that's the question is silence the same as agreement um who can question reason and how can it happen we've had throughout this course three different Traditions um one is this idea and I I think it is in the western Canon it's specifically back to Aristotle um against the sophists right against the populists that reasonable language is how we develop the best policy reason to debate with evidence and argument is the best way to produce the best political outcomes the problem is and we've said since day one is that um contestation is inherent to politics and groups the rhetorics the sophists could simply say whatever can be argued and whatever convinces people is what's right right it's morally relativist but it's also politically Salient it's very Machiavellian and and it's kind of how advertising in PR functions right as long as we're not committing explicit falsehoods we are convincing you that this is good and that is bad you need to throw out that and buy this right whatever it is um and then so the critical tradition then is really about how reason reflects power and so the ability of a Prof to tell a student that they're wrong and that student responding with silence reflects a system of power where that happens here's an example I just pulled this example we can pull these examples this is what I'm doing the philosophers you can find examples just lying about everywhere I got this one in my email inbox it's from um the hill times so this is Parliament Hill in Canada um and the question raised here is about the the even the the need or accountability of language so this is an interesting one in that the Department of National Resources was asked a series of point to questions by the conservative opposition um about what um as an MP that MP in a reasonable Democratic Society and a government agency has an obligation to provide information to that MP um the weird part about this though is that these mining projects are something that's contentious between Canada U.S and it's an opposition member um and that the idea then of of these questions being asked by an mtmp um for the government with an explicit memo was do not answer the question directly but provide a response to the spirit of the questions which is to say language means nothing it's you can basically respond to any question or say anything you can speak past each other because there's no obligation to some notion of the truth so this is the current this is the federal liberal government telling a conservative opposition member um that we are going to answer your questions how we think your questions are asking us something but we're not going to reasonably say this and this is in the memo they've got here it's way too small to see but its idea is basically uh provide a response to the spirit of the question um and and direct it as appropriate so this idea of of public relations or of advertising of marketing is about using language as a way to convince people that they shouldn't think they should just react um you know redirect the question bridge to what you want to talk about deal with broad arguments discuss them the way that you want to deal with them deal with the spirit of the question I don't know what a spirit of a question is it seems very weird to talk about the fact that you as an obligation have an obligation to answer a question but you can reason your way into I don't know I don't I don't know can we have commensurate ideas do our ideas anything but a reflection of power and this here is is a standing MP asking a government agency to provide answers and the government's attitude is [Music] we don't have to have to have reasonable answers or reasonable discussions and so this is a more substantive question about the language we use the ways we think and the way we organize society as to whether or not we see it as being reasonable and having something in common or we see it as entirely contingent and contested and every group is going to decide what is reasonable for them and so the question becomes what are we doing in this chapter are are we engaging in a form of trying to convince people to be more reasonable I don't like the use of disability here I like the idea of ableism but the textbook has decided to go in this root of framing it through this farcamon of disability because it it's has multiple meanings but I'm not sure we agree with that I don't know what the answer is here and and I don't have any solutions to the answer and I'm going to make mistakes and you're going to make mistakes and you're going to have to decide which language you think is appropriate
