 so as I talked about in the last video this idea of it being a concern to the majority is again referring back to the idea of the the social and the majority of the social who then binds together through things like the social contract um so again this is one of the problems of having the chapters written by different authors is that in part you're going to get these ways in which the contract is framed differently so um search contract again we've talked about Hobbs locks and lock and Rousseau but there's also these ideas of the racial contract and the sexual contract which is just the agreement by which a social organization bounds together in the regulatory Norms that come to be understood as as whatever that contract is right so this decides in a you know classic social contract sense as we've talked about who gets civil political and social rights how much freedom of the person do you have freedom of speech thought and Faith right to own property engaging contracts and rates to Justice the problem is with the way that this is framed and the problem we have in thinking about this in terms of these issues is that are these inherent or are they entitlements the danger of the state-based framework that we have done since the beginning of the discussion about politics the political and the state is that it starts from the Assumption of the king the leader the ruler as the because we are advising the king the ruler the leader it's not at all clear that's how rights actually happen it's more often than not it's as we talked about with anarchism the community coming together to demand something and them being like okay just don't overthrow us we'll give you this as in order to not do that so the question of entitlements um entitlements often have to do with political mobilization and the dominant group is saying this is what we should get but you also have this problem of you know small minority groups having influence over power and influence we could just talk about like a billionaire class right the ability of them to influence the political outcome based more strongly on their capacity to have influence through money right um and then we have the problem of if there is a complaint that my right is being violated who's going to adjudicate those complaints if it's the dominant group then you've got real problems um and then how do we establish that that degree upon which who can participate and how um so even these idea of gender normativity gender roles and who should play and how they should play in those roles is going to be part of the issue here and so this idea of of establishing just the rights themselves and then the expansive vision of rights that the chapter talks about doesn't really talk about how those rights are contested and how they come about and the extent to which they are based in a tacit liberal teleology right as we've talked about throughout the idea that liberals believe that reason is driving forward uh progress and reason will result in positive outcomes for groups as they are able to clearly articulate their claim for rights that's just not how the history of this has happened and we've seen this already with women rights in the last 10 years um the undp just did a report the last 10 years we've seen a regression in women's rights so the idea that they naturally progress forward is is very much this based on this teleology that's not based on evidence or fact right and so we have the expansion of of social rights that takes place especially um during the Cold War the the Communist systems were arguing that we're providing social benefits social rights economic welfare security and the ability to live upon these standards that we have set that are different from your Western standards or outside those standards and they're a different way to do it we've seen this when we talked last week about undrip this idea of group group or intersectional rights that are just now coming about and then we've got this broader question about the next set of are we going to be able to establish the non-human world as having inherent environmental rights animal rights the rights to live the rights for us to live in some type of balance with our environment so therefore there isn't a right to pollute for those things and so the the idea here is that framing things in terms of Rights is always going to introduce a level of intervulnerability because it's going to say we're going to have to have somebody to to establish the rights enforce the rights adjudicate the rights and defend those rights and so the idea of of having a a sense of self that is secure is going to be a better community that can establish a basis whereby you're not going to face threats to your to your sense of self your sense of justice and that hierarchies themselves are always going to undermine that by providing a level of impunity for those who are able to to set the terrain of the debate right the how we think about these things and who we we think about about what is reasonable and what isn't reasonable for a time during patent medicine it was the idea of you know the freedom to develop whatever product you want and put it on the market even if it's for kids and it's cough syrup and it has alcohol cannabis chloroform morphine hydrochloride chloride in it as a as a sedative and expectorant um and this idea then that that these are how we establish um that this is somehow something we need to regulate or something we need to say um that we should do this and so rights are not equally uh allocated or protected to everyone the right to property in in the patent medicine case comes at the expense of our Collective rights to you know not have our kids be drugged and uh facing other consequences of that like patent medicine what they gave to babies back in the day was just Bonkers um and so um this long history of exclusionary practices and laws um are all over the place uh you know women denying the right to vote until 1918 and then in the provinces it it moves around after that Japanese Canadians uh banned from voting until 1949 and this idea of limiting enfranchisement is still bound up in the idea that we have a majority ages where you can vote we haven't really we don't really talk about I guess it's capacity when you're elderly about whether or not you're right to vote or be the leader of the country about age limits term limits those ideas about maybe people shouldn't be in positions of power and authority if they don't have the capacity to do it but then we have to adjudicate their capacity right and one person's capacity isn't another's capacity so who should bound that and how should we decide and which groups get to decide then and so the danger of course is that if we heavily regulate some bodies um and then we're like whoa why is this outcome happening I have no idea why it's the case um you will see that that's the case and so particularly we can Target and look at the ways in which these groups have been targeted over time um just literally not being able to vote until 1960 the gendered provisions of the ACT we've talked about this before but losing status but losing status is is more than it also loses your ability to participate in the community from which you you come and then having Outsiders decide which is still the case today Outsiders just decide the legitimacy of certain type markers of identity and then what what benefits are conferred like education and spending and access to health care is still very much this majoritarian minority uh problem and so this idea of of but I just I literally was looking up one of these memes beforehand and ran into a current Reddit post of talking about because I was trying to find stuff on the the Indian act as a as a kind of racist holdover just in terms of the naming of it right like language um and then a bunch of like simulatory the arguments being made over and over again it's like we've learned literally nothing through all this time and so indigenous women's rights come through legal challenges they come through political mobilization um this ability to to go to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1973 and articulate no no you you're undermining our our political rights and capacity or going to the human rights committee in 1979 and saying we are being targeted for forms of Oppression and exclusion from basic human rights and so the capacity of basic human rights and being able to articulate them and having a place to do that so having the ability to to to how to stand in front of the Supreme Court or the human rights committee and make those claims is this issue and so it's not until 1985 that we get some of these these issues through the uh Senator Sandra Nichols um you know being in 2005 the ability to to make these choices and not have them made for you is all about these relationships of dynamics of control I'm not going to talk about the impunity here I was going to talk about Haiti um I think it'll conflict the argument a bit too much I just have the special repertoire for human rights in Haiti saying that the UN the one that assigned the special repertoire to talk about human rights and it was violated by the UN and because of that they have impunity and there is no mechanism no feedback mechanism um for those issues that came from that we have these impunities all over the place we frame things like uh teenage pregnancy as a problem of um social concern but we frame that social concern and I saw this one this was a meme going around about the idea of 15 year old girls fathering children from men who were 20 to 29. we frame that as a as an issue of sexual moral Panic about who's having sex with who but not about the idea that this is inappropriate or there are structures in place here this this idea of victim blaming is built into if you allow the majority Community to set the terrain back to that Meme from the first time where you have somebody clearly articulating their sense of self and then the dominant group just gets to interpret what that articulation means and so we have serious substantive issues about if we're just now coming to terms with recognizing the existence of groups to articulate their vision of Rights we haven't even started listening to those rights yet
