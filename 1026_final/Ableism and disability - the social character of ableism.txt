 so this farcamon of of disability um produces these contradictions because Society by its nature is is framing things that are reasonable um that's what policy is right um you're able to justify why you're doing it even if it's just a majoritarian sensibility um you're you're doing something because you can reasonably argue that it is producing some output right whatever it is and so this idea of of Rights versus burden is a kind of constant framing um the idea of an cost is is friend I think there's a third option there right this idea of seeing them as lesser while also having these kind of social Dimensions about workplace accommodations or how work should function um I think it's probably framed wrong um that was the thing when when Nick and I undertook redoing 10 20 we came with the idea with the teaching support center of really adopting Universal Design right about this idea of producing um the capacity of people being able to to to have injuries be ill experience things concussions whatever that make it hard for them to learn at one point so then they have access to these resources no matter what the circumstance right the weird part about that is is that these innovators in particular with something like chat gbt ruthless Ruth's ruthlessly exploits the universality of that design as also a mechanism by which it can accumulate all sorts of information assess immediately undermine Challenge and so the universality of design is also one that makes it very easy to be appropriated right um here's an example right for a price uh neuro neurodivergent fonts I was looking at this whether or not I could could Institute these fonts we've seen these before for people with different ways of of reading they are better but it's a subscription right it's like all the fonts you have included in your stuff paid for designed now we're saying that if you want this you have to subscribe to it for a lifetime maybe we need to do that but it's weird right that your ability is it's not just that you're you're where you're providing you with a useful service right I grew up with the emergence of the internet so the emergence of the internet was you buy you bought software you ran the software yes it might have security flaws yes it might have the rest of it but you you owned that piece of software it worked forever that was a bad framework in terms of security and updates it was a great framework in just having the thing and using an old ass computer um that worked right um rather than updates which intentionally disable or argue that there's a security vulnerability and therefore we can no longer support that right we've got life cycles now on this stuff that's two to three years not very environmentally sound and so thinking about the ways in which we have produced this notion of of using things like fonts to generate new sources of revenue I'm not sure that a font needs a subscription it's a font right like maybe it's going to be updated I don't know it's a font it's so weird um anyways so thinking about um ability and disability is not just social factors a social phenomenon how we organize ourselves in terms of social effectivity so this one is used this has been memeed to death as well I'm not going to put any in here because they're really offensive but um the idea here is that liberal Notions of reason and equality result in the idea that everyone benefits from the exact same supports under the assumption of the absent subject that we're all the same doesn't make a ton of sense it only works for majority communities that actually are the same which given what we did last week and dealing with just gender half of us aren't the same at bare minimum right um it's probably I maybe a third is dictating that the sameness goes for everybody um and maybe even less than that right um okay and so when we're talking about Equity then it's also about providing supports specifically needed for each group and so this is efforts needed to overcome the differences between people and so we want to have equality but in order to actually have equality we need to have Equity because we need more supports for those people The Next Step would be Justice the source of the foundation of the lack of equality and the lack of equity is addressed by a mechanism which everybody gets the same issue everybody gets access to the same thing and so um here this is this is a good example of this I'll do this and go back because this is a good way some people believe that Society should not adjust or adapt to support them marginalized community if that Community is a relatively small part of the population this is a perfect opportunity to talk about a phenomenon called the curb cut effect curb Cuts those miniature ramps on sidewalks were first built in California in the 1960s to address the needs of wheelchair users they are now Universal sidewalk feature relied upon by people with strollers bikes scooters carts and more the curb cut effect demonstrates that when we make changes to help a marginalized Community we as an entire Society benefit closed captioning was created for those with hearing impairments and is now used by anyone in a noisy environment text to speech is useful for anyone with busy hands gender-neutral bathrooms are a godsend for anyone just seeking privacy inclusive family and parental leave policies benefit straight couples with unique caregiving situations steps we make to take care of the few positively impact the many [Music] see this whole lecture in a tick tock much easier um and so this social asocial characterization is largely just about people not liking change I guess I use the words I want to use don't make me use different words I use the steps I want to use don't make me use different words until I need those steps or words different then I want them changed and so this is the problem of kind of reducing everything to thinking about individuals is that we don't think about the social benefit of doing things for public for everybody and so um this idea of disability as an individual limitation between a person and their environment really reinforces this absent subject and yes I I would like a glossary for this week as well just to kind of go over these types of things because there's a lot out there and I just haven't combed through it but also I do think these platforms reinforce certain ways of doing it and so disability is seen as an individual problem as this kind of biology gone wrong that's not even a legible sentence to me um because it's a a moral assertion of a fact right like what does that even mean I don't like sky bad Sky what like it just doesn't make any sense anyways so this is very much thinking like a state that you then identify with your state because I guess you pay into taxes I mean you don't have to pay into taxes you can live in Florida and have sales tax but you contribute to that society and therefore Society shouldn't do things that you don't want even if you benefit from them you know what I mean we end up in these places and so these programs are reducing everything to forms of degradation or a proof of disability or testing protocols um this idea of the this medical bureaucratic management of disability these ableist assumptions Remains unquestioned by the largest Society um I had an example here I heard this anecdotally that they apparently Rick Mercer talks about this I couldn't find the video though um this is not just like like marginalized people these are people who fought for the uh that veteran services needs you to verify that your limb hasn't grown back and they changed it so it wasn't annually you only had to do it every three years well that's great these people are having to try travel hundreds of kilometers to the locus local veterans the closest Veterans Affairs office to prove that their limb hasn't grown back like that level of bureaucracy is just I don't even know we could talk about bureaucracy we go into Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucracy about who it's for and what it's doing um this kind of governmentality of of doing it it's not at all clear and so the example used in the textbook is just this idea of borrowing a book from the University Library information wants to be free steelbooks um and that uh I didn't say that um that books stacked on shelves up a stairwell or narrow Corridor requires vision and physical Mobility I've had I think I had a student last year check to see how many braille books Western has in the library I think we have one so there's that uh but I mean we are using like um my mom's got all the software now that just reads it and listen Apple's been great on this they're putting accessibility in Apple devices and everyone's using them like we see this all the time people are getting it at in the Innovative sectors it's the government sectors that that remain behind and I I will talk about that in the next video about why that is um and so all of these things require Vision physical Mobility agility um or assistance in retrieving books um on higher desks or at some type of government certification that you have this need rather than do it listen I'm not a big fan of physical books um I do think there's a debate about whether or not they're more efficient than having a PDF that requires a store of energy infinitely but we do know that like they're extremely heavy they require a lot of cooling and heating they take up physical space and in the case of robots at UT it's slowly sinking right it's because it's so heavy books are heavy um and so the problem of course is that the onus is put on the individual to seek assistance rather than develop the social environments to provide services if it's a service it should be provided right access to knowledge then Still Remains ableist design remains ableist and then we have questions about how do governments make decisions about design as it relates to ableism what kind of input and whose input so it's not just that you do the design it's that you have the social structures in place to deal with the consequences of the design so this is in Toronto this is just somebody talking about the situations in Toronto what ableism looks like in the winter this is supposed to be an accessible crosswalk and because of the the snow pile I can't even get to the button and the curb cutout is covered in snow in order to physically cross the street I have to wait in the lane of oncoming traffic until the light changes and the curb cut it on the other side is also inaccessible due to snow as well as the button City of Toronto give your head a shake and that's [Music] was that supposed to be a loop anyways um and so this is exactly how these are social questions these are individual questions and that's not an individual question that's a systemic question that what's the point of putting in the infrastructure and design if you're not going to service the design and infrastructure right if you're not going to do those things and so all of this un framing from the as a right space model to individual experience of Rights misses everything in the Middle Design infrastructure bureaucracy registration development all of it's in there
