 so this leads us to the gender analysis in IR um there's a book by Patrice Patrick Thaddeus Jackson called the conduct of inquiry and international relations that argues that feminism is the most coherent international relations approach because it provides like Marxism a coherent vision of the world like realism it explains violence and like liberalism explains why we should try to stop violence so um there are many different gender analyzes in in IR there isn't a coherent singular way to do it the international Journal of feminist studies is quite good on this stuff gender absolutely is a power relation and then Society privileges certain relationships to masculinity ideas and masculinity who possesses masculinity and what types of things they should be we've talked about this with the gender stuff I've got more than enough in the glossary that deals with this and devalues those forms of femininity again I don't love the gender binary it's also a process gender is social construction femininity metamasculine deviant sexuality again we talked about this um man I wouldn't have used that language but anyways um sexual violence award time or Advance against women is more appropriate and so the idea here is that um all of these will matter and there's a gender development index and there's lots of different ways to to do this um it can draw issue attention to issues such as the gender division of labor gender violence intersections of gender-based class normal stuff we talked about all this gender stuff it just does it at the international level um I'll provide an example here so I mentioned it earlier in the gender week um this is the reference to it um this uh was the argument of uh one of the ward 7 counselors in Hamilton that said as a woman when I have my period I would be stocked these things at home before I went out when I was prepared as a woman I was always prepared so I cannot support an effort to make menstrual products uh broadly and freely available in public spaces okay um I find a little bit uncomfortable that we're talking about this for an hour and a half um it's a stigma attached to menstruating she said it's natural body of function if it's private matter we can't uh talk about it this type of stuff matters this former student of mine um who pushed and now London does provide menstrual products in public spaces all of this comes from this type of work about how we have and this is what the international relations approach can do it can do like this textbook does go from the abstract to the specific but in ways that that matter and so this is a key aspect of gender equality because menstruation is part of healthy fertility this is in in women this can be an average of 3000 days per Life one quarter of the global population at any time that we simply do not talk about that even the human rights mechanisms did not talk about until the 2000s um and so this is the framing this is the ways in which femininity is devalued or degraded in ways in which we don't celebrate the thing by which we are here from in one way shape or form uh because you have to be here somebody had to go through the process of birth for you to be here I don't think we have fully artificial uteruses yet and that's the hashtag male pregnant then then I can do it then I can carry a baby to turn but until then we can't do that so we've got lots of examples of ways in which just basic things like this is a quarter the global population at any time is dealing with this and yet to this day we still decrease the confidence the liking sit further away this idea that um somehow you're less confident I'm an actress and today I'm going out into the Streets of London to discover how ordinary people react to an instant involving tampons we'll see how it goes I'm so sorry that's rather embarrassing we'll never see you again [Music] thank you guys sorry guys one quarter of the world's population are any time but it's still framed in this very specific way so we have a lot of unease about discussing it um one of the things that International feminist activism has focused on is specifically around human rights mechanisms is dealing with this and so we have all the different ways in which these euphemisms function as forms of reproducing this that simple lack of access to materials is a persistent problem the fact that the lack of access to materials means that you have to use all these other things is a way in which this is a Perpetual issue so this has direct educational impacts all over the world on a regular basis and so it is all these issues this is just in the article what would magically if men could menstruate and women could not menstruation would become enviable worthy masculine event men would brag about how long and how much Congress would fund a National Institute of uh just Memoria I can't can't pronounce that to Stamp Out monthly discomfort sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free and so this in general in India for example costs about five days a month of loss of education for the girl child around the world um we we know that there are all sorts of correlations to reproductive attract infections and health problems but we don't study the issue because we don't talk about the issue there are additional problems outside the home um uh as it intersects with ability and disability um uh women wait on average seven years before seeking medical help and then homeless women informal settlements refugee camps prisoners women with disabilities sex workers all have to encounter these issues and so it becomes a human rights concern one that nobody talks about counselors in Hamilton about being on the streets is probably being a female if you're a woman you like your face clean you know you like feeling good smelling good yeah period times are not good times for us Hi how are you it is very difficult to have your period and very uncomfortable every day I wake up and I do my daily routine because nobody wants to smell you know and that's that's kind of a big deal out here I've been doing this for so long I'm 27 years old this will be my eighth winner out here straight we had a pretty rough childhood growing up my mom was a victim of domestic violence and so she put us through a lot I went into the system she got custody of me again and basically she was like you know what I don't want you in the system anymore but you can't be here I hadn't lived at home since I was you know 10 years old you know and I took care of myself there was no keeping me home anyway you know whether she if she wanted to or not there's so many kids that it's like they fall through the cracks I guess priority this is then you know be full this is not a poor issue this is not just about getting products to those who need them which is obviously a priority this is really about bringing dignity to women I tend to flock to places like this which is like public parks where they have public bathrooms I come here to Thompson Square Park and I do my my Cleanup in the in the sink I get a big cap like like the big McDonald's cup and um I fill it up with water I'll actually like I'll straddle it this way you're able to you know pour water and you know use the soap and um and basically wash over the toilet and get a really good cleansing at the same time that's the best so this is the problem and this is in no way unique to homeless uh individuals are unhoused I think we're supposed to say now in language um but very few countries have any type of water sanity Water Sanitation and hygiene programs um wash programs and if they do um two percent of it's on hygiene promotion in the Beijing platform for Action in 1995 reproductive health and Sexual Health sexual education was mentioned but there was no explicit uh reference to menstrual hygiene there are no human rights mechanisms to deal with it but we do have a human rights mechanisms of the rights of the the ability of men to shave when they are imprisoned or prisons prisoners of War there's no reference to menstruation at all the Human Rights Council did not acknowledge it until 2014. it wasn't even mentioned as an issue and so a lot of what we think about when we're talking about policy and these type of things is the structure it has to be so deeply structured in all of our lives that we both find it uncomfortable to talk about that we don't talk about we don't think it's political we think it's private and yet the like more than almost any other issue it is something that people are dealing with on a daily basis around the world and yet we have no mechanisms no language no ways of thinking or dealing with it so it directly confronts human dignity it's not even clear that we need to have the stigma around it it's something that we we have even mechanisms like the convention on the elimination all forms of discrimination against women it's not really useful here because this is specifically to menstruating bodies it is specific to them and so those bodies need these resources and yet we don't have any mechanisms to deal with this and so it's interesting to think about the ways in which putting this as as Central to a political aim is the effort to take it and and create human rights in a kind of practical way at the international level because we have the human right to health human right to water human right to sanitation but we need something like a human right to access to materials to absorb blood during menstruation and so hygiene facilities and services need to be culturally acceptable which means we have to have States distinguish what it is they need we need to have different options available based on what preferences are and capabilities are and likelihood of of you know what is the most culturally appropriate or appropriate for that person and then you have to have access to water and Disposal Services so this is a massive issue that impacts millions and millions of people and yet we have no mechanisms internationally to deal with it everything is put back to the state and the state is largely framed through these Notions about you know taboo and it's largely dominated by men and so this becomes this issue of where should this fit because it doesn't seem to fit in those three dominant approaches it's not just a norm issue because it can't be uniform and we need to actually do the work to break some of the taboos and the men in charge in order to make this a priority or issue and then how do we override those cultural norms some of the they are and so this idea of this being an issue it's a human rights issue and again it's one that everyone benefits from making sure that everybody has access to resources to dignity and to education is human rights and so it's not clear that this is even fully one issue for a group or for women or for men or whatever it's it's everybody's issue right that we need to protect this ways in which we can do things but then if culture is the impediment to the this right do we need to override culture in order to do this so it raises these these interesting kind of feminist questions that we can come back to about all these competing perspectives and the ways in which we kind of have to work them together um we didn't talk about the coveted pandemic very much because I don't think it's as relevant each theory has different ways of dealing with things um you know we can talk about the ways in which you know realism kind of deals it's not a state security issue we do have a bit of blaming each other I don't think anything was rising to the levels of of conflict um liberalism yes cooperation institutions in the who I mean we the Liberals believe we should use the who but they weren't really well prepared for the criticisms of it um yeah I mean that's pretty weak that's some weak sauce um rethinking of norms around travel trade borders and immigration sure that's going to happen but it'll go away to whenever the next thing happens we'll forget about the last thing post-structuralism mobilizing a discourse fighting or mobilizing the discourse and saying it's not a real thing right like that was Trump right like just didn't believe he had it didn't didn't believe in it could do that stuff like you can if you have resources you can deny reality right um and then the gender analysis that the impact on on women and and um well in fact on everybody that these issues relate to us all so this is a the kind of the different approaches the different ways and I tried to bring in examples for each of those approaches to talk about the ways in which we need to think about what those theories contribute and how they can help us think about these things
