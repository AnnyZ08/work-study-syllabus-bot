 so sure let's call them disruptive theories I don't know how disruptive they are but sure we can call them disruptive gender analysis maybe but feminism's not just specific to this point in time right um okay so we'll go through these each constructivism post-structuralism and gender analysis um I don't believe in the first I think the second I mean fine it was in the 90s gender analysis absolutely makes sense to me um I say I don't believe in the first because constructivism is normally a method masquerading as a theory um I'll explain how that functions in a second um and so I do think there's a value here in not being so pedantic about how we do some of these things so like if it doesn't fit one of our models it doesn't work okay great because your models didn't explain this collapse of the Soviet Union at all famously there was a realist Journal that published an article um like it was after because the publication time took a while they published an article after the Soviet Union had fallen about how the Soviet Union would continue in for decades right so they didn't explain that neither of those approaches explain that I mean of course the the Marxist approach was implicated in what the Soviets were doing so all three of them were kind of thrown in um and so what we were looking at then are ways in which global politics could be more malleable people and so we like to say the word constructivism but we don't normally think about who's doing construction or how it's constructing and once we ask that question we end up back at those other approaches anyway but neither of you are there um so this is I don't know that the others saw it as an objective reality because marxists don't think it's objective they think it's all class based the realists think everything's conflict based and the Liberals think everything is is inter is mediated by institutions so that's what I mean I I think if you have a constructivist approach you end up using one of those theories anyways but it's it we sure let's say the importance of norms even though in my gender lecture I said the that we should try to be as anti-normative as possible this is the opposite of that problem why I'm not a big fan it's just the idea of creating long-standing and shared expectations about individual State Behavior so that paper I had on the ioc was specifically about norms and it was about how the Olympic movement the olympism movement was trying to create Norms that were confusing and so the the paper I did with a friend of mine was on Norm confusion just the idea that we should be able to to say that this Norm means we should do this but in practice it just means well we're talking about this thing now but we don't know that it actually manifests into outcomes because that requires the politics again so um we can we can see the ways in which states and actors and individuals and groups conceive of themselves differently they can construct new Norms such as things like um a ban on land mines um the idea of not State security but human security or the idea that states shouldn't um just protect themselves they should protect people the responsibility to protect um so we have a bunch of those I would say that another way to talk about Norms is the idea of of buzzwords they function like this they allow broad normative agreement on issues so we all said we want more participation but we don't know what it means we all want more empowerment but of who I don't know if we want empowerment of everybody that Civil Society should matter okay but which actors and what if the two actors in Civil Society are fighting on two sides of things poverty reduction great how and voices of the poor should count okay in what and so this idea then is that Norms allow us to agree but they don't necessarily tell us what to do and to do we need one of those approaches again so that's why I'm saying it's a method in search of a theory right um and so the shift from government as the responsible actor to governance is part of this so institutions now famously the bank of international settlements is a normative institution it technically has no capacity to do anything it uses each of the states coming together they meet all the heads of the Central Bank meet and say this is what we will do but it doesn't Force any state to do anything it just is a site of agreement so it's an example of governance but it doesn't manifest any form of government right it doesn't even it's not an institution per se it's just a kind of like meeting place and so like the G7 and G20 they get together and they do governance but there's no effort to establish a president of the the G7 that rules all the G7 members right so it becomes we become focused on normative questions on this feel-good rhetoric rather than using coercion Force institutions we want to have empowering changing ideas and minds but it's not at all clear what the ways in which we can do that so this is a a great video of this um it follows this Fabian socialist principle of the United Nations that these are real problems and I don't deny in any way that they aren't real problems we're just not clear on who is going to provide the solutions and so this gets me every time I'll probably cry I have a daughter it it just gets me this girl effect but look at how it builds your normative consensus but it doesn't tell you specifically how you're going to go about it and who's going to be responsible for doing it so this is a good example of kind of buzzword symbolism foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] reconstructed [Music] thank you [Music] thank you doesn't even say who it's from so it's it really is good because it doesn't say who it's from and then listen we can 100 agree on that so we have a constructed way in which we think about things we reconstruct it in order to produce a solution but what does that solution look like so let's say we we I mean you ask the Marxist just tax the billionaires give to the girl okay fine the Liberals are much more complicated so one we want to increase funding to those institutions but we don't know in our current institutional system if a a state like Saudi Arabia would want to undertake those mechanisms so we don't have any liberalism just says cooperate but what if somebody doesn't want to right what if you're doing with the Nazis or something How would how would you encounter that um then we would have the issue of the the kind of realist they don't have a whole lot to say about this because it's not state-based you could try to overthrow the state in which this stuff is happening but we don't know that that's going to produce an outcome that's going to be useful here so we clearly do need another approach this is why we need feminism because those approaches fails but we don't know the constructivism just making us change things it's going to do it because what all it's really doing is it's producing this idea of challenging the status quo with a new form of inclusivity so we all need to care about the girl effect we need to focus on the girl child as this mechanism of social change and by doing that you become the expert you can start organizations like a meet away and say we are going to do this and then you get all this resources and capabilities but it's not at all clear like if the state where this is happening is saying no outside interference States will best explain the situation and so we are trying to convince those State leaders that this matters and so we are trying to convince them constructed in their mind tell them the importance of this but the problem is is that this follows a pattern that we've seen before and a lack of theory of colonialism leads to this idea that we can just spread Norms that we innovate and develop in the west onto other context cultures and situations and tell them the way that they're doing their context culture and situation is wrong what is the appropriate age to have a kid I agree with them it's not though at that age but it just says when she's ready so what if different societies disagree on when that is right and so the problem here is that this reproduces the idea that this kind of myth of broad public support needed in order to create policy change but we don't know what the broad public supports policy change is going to look like it's this idea of thinking or feeling first and so development myths work through emotional identification not through rationality they build and sustain the feeling of conviction that people need in order to act good argument has its place but it's secondary to something else the feeling of rightness backed by normative instruments like the Millennium development goals which serve the ceremonial function of bolstering togetherness and purposefulness to strive to a Visionary goal those are all normative agreements but we don't know that those normative agreements don't require the theories in order to accomplish the goals all we know is that we've got normative agreements
