 so we'll go through this as as we go but politics in particular has done a pretty poor job of thinking these categories Canadian politics and public policy have largely been absent discussions of these until like 70s 80s right when I when I wrote that chapter with the two friends of mine on teaching race in IR um there's this huge book that came out that had two I think two or three discussions of race in a in how to teach in in international relations two thousand pages and two or three discussions um this happens in a leadership literature right the leadership literature had what was it 5 000 pages and had almost no discussion of gender and Leadership except for women in male leadership not thinking about actual deployments of gender so when we're thinking about these things um you know race is a central organizing concept of European Enlightenment imperialism colonialism enslavement and yet this myth of the absent subject this liberal reading of this experience largely produces the kind of practical construction of of racial hierarchies without it without a thought literally the absence of thought over and over again we get tropes that fill in this noise the idea of manifest destiny of this idea that Americans have a right to the North American continent and the Western Hemisphere that anything that happens within that zone is their domain and if you look at the history of American foreign policy especially in the Western Hemisphere North and South America it has largely been one of intervention over and over and over again Canada has done this as well uh there's I think it's is it angler has a black book a Canadian foreign policy this just talks about the number of times Canada's intervened in Latin America because of the big Banks to to defend bank's interests so this idea of one that this this group on the on the supposed top has the burden of of leadership the idea that we have to civilize everywhere else these ideas about who who is the best kind of and we still have all of these categorizations there I think they're still embedded in how we think about migration and how we rank migration uh in Canada has to do with point system has to do with money and where you come from and your ability to speak the language or all forms in which we dictate which communities should be able to come here um and then of course this idea of the sexualization and the threat or the excessive sexualization of certain communities against uh our sense of morality these Australian migrants who are being too salacious for Canadian hygiene in the 1920s um the Perpetual problem of orientalism which doesn't go away islamophobia in particular is persistent um you could just see it in the discussions of how Canada dealt with Syrian refugees and the idea that we would take only women and children as if somehow Syrian men are because they're men and because they're syrians were a threat and therefore they shouldn't be included that we have this idea that indigenous communities are Vanishing and that we create policies in order to assimilate and Kill The Indian in the child assimilate indigenous communities so we get growing numbers of indigenous communities off Reserve people of indigenous descent off Reserve that we still frame as as disappearing when in fact they're not not even close and so the idea of politics of race science is is really that we we hold on to these Concepts because they seem to have Foundation even though they've been disproven by science over and over again um it still follows and is all over the place in the academy Western universities is highlighted in this text because of the fact that we didn't deny rushton's work until 2020 right like this is no long time ago this is in the present and so this idea of of this is just one I picked to talk about why it's so persistent and how we think about these things people imagine that people have always thought about skin color in this racialized way and we really haven't that idea is no more than a few hundred years old it's not really until the age of colonialism in uh 17th century that you start getting the idea that each continent has its own individual kind of people it arose in a very specific moment in history in the 17th century you're taking long trips by ship and you're struck by how different people look then you remember them when you got on so this is the first edition of Systema nature so the systems of Nature and for man linear distinguishes four varieties these varieties correspond to the four continents where it really changes is in the tenth edition of Systema nature this is the foundation of scientific racism he brings in moral character so the American is red and choleric and stands up straight the European white sanguine and muscular the Asian sallow melancholic and stiff and finally the African black phlegmatic and lazy so these stereotypes have endured Through the Ages if you're going to take a group of people and you're going to decide that they're not people anymore then you need something to justify that you can be defined very differently depending on the country that you're in or the time that you're in and that's how these categories have always been used they are political tools that change depending on their usefulness to whoever is doing the categorization remember Eugenics though is borrowed from the Americans by the not they look to American policies in order to generate some of these things ah I didn't want to do this BBC does more than I would do I don't like the exploiting of bodies for political arguments and so so chauvinistically British that they don't think about the harm of showing images species on the planet humans have far less genetic variation than chimpanzees do and yet those chimpanzees look the same to me there were never any pure races there is no Gene that exists in all the members of One race and not another there is no black Gene there is no white genes human groups overlap completely in their genetic variations in the same way that you're related to your family you can get a kind of fuzzy genetic similarity but when you get to the Continental level which is really where we're talking about race that genetic similarity is so fuzzy and so statistically weak as to be almost meaningless we have this Envy of fields where things are hyper simplistic we want to be able to look at a genome and say that people are these kind of concrete immutable things that cannot be changed genetics doesn't work that way it's the product of many genes interacting with each other and their environments fully answer the question about what a living thing is it's going to be about much more than James if I were to go out onto the street today and find someone of Indian Heritage like myself and randomly then pick someone who is not of Indian Heritage it is perfectly statistically possible for my genome to have more in common with that person who isn't of Indian Heritage than that person who is so that's the point is that the science that underpins this isn't telling us anything about this stuff and yet we still utilize the concepts as if they are scientific right um this idea of what your Europeans as being pure and everybody else is impure and this is what they were talking about the genetic variation within the Human Genome Project is not statistically significant it doesn't mean anything it's not statistically founded in any way um but that doesn't mean we don't do this stuff um that we have the promotion of force sterilization by the Toronto demon medicine uh Charles clerk as I showed in the last video and as I've got here there is ways in which the Canada persistently does this through policies that talk about child welfare back to that original thing the idea of childhood or children as being something that needs to be protected which then justifies the coercion of women into sterilization because we don't want them to have more babies because we fear about the overpopulation of that type of person right um and on top of that we have the eugenicists working in the academy in our Academy that Russians work well it was clear for a long time that he was engaged in this stuff it wasn't formally discredited until 2020 there's the recent retraction of some of those articles but we have these problems these persistent problems and this has been the problem um with the the Kenneth hilborn too around the history program that we have these forms in which racism is embedded in the academy is perpetuated in the academy and because of the denial we don't want to address these issues or we want to say that they're aberrant and that they aren't part of the structural hierarchical Authority that comes from the subject positioning of being experts right and that expertise is something that allows us to speak authoritatively on all matters even on experiences that we don't have and so that's the danger of these institutions and the academies they confer power and authority to make claims that might not have anything to do with the research that you're doing and then even when you combine that research if you don't do it well it becomes shoddy and it becomes these types of claims that are made that don't have any scientific basis but still are made with scientific Authority
