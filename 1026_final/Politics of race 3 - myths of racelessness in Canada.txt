 so this is what the issue that we're talking about over and over again this isn't perfect it's a bit old but it's very much how Canada has framed these issues in the past and and how it thinks about the kind of liberal project of multiculturalism is that somehow that liberalism doesn't see or doesn't need to think race diverse movies yeah like Moonlight or lion hidden figures and fences movies that didn't like just feature white people so interesting I never really thought about really even after the whole Oscars so white thing and all the Articles written about it call me crazy but I okay races like often like a pretty obvious thing to observe it's not like racist to notice I had to laugh Zach um my goodness I only see one race the human race such you're only telling yourself that so you don't have to think about racism or confront your own prejudices no I'm not I'm a man Katie you know that no honestly I just guessed this is gonna sound nuts but I don't see gender and I don't see sex I just see people you don't see how men and women look different no I just see like shapeless blonde blonde okay and if one of those shapeless flops were pregnant you would then know that it was a woman to me it could just be okay so this is satirizing the the absent liberal subject position of not being able to see any specific um characteristics of bodies but I will argue hashtag male preg they're working on artificial uteruses and I probably would do it um I have a baby if I could so some of these assumptions are built into the way that we think about things and a lot of and we'll get into this next week and talk about gender a lot of these things are socially and technologically constructed as to how they're experienced so anyways we'll let it continue a big [Music] quality I'm just a good person unless you're blind you can tell that people have inherent differences oh wouldn't know if I was blind or not because I don't see disabilities I'm not a monster so if someone were in a wheelchair you wouldn't be able to see the wheelchair I ever seen never seen a wheel I don't know what a wheelchair looks like if you if someone were in a wheelchair you would not install a ramp in your building I would refuse what if someone was missing a limb it's perhaps tuck if someone were deaf talk with them as if they could hear why are you so proud of yourself okay well here's a thought maybe you don't get it because you have less experience on Earth than I do experience we're all older than but I don't see age oh come on you're telling me if there was an old woman and a baby you wouldn't be able to tell which one's older one of them is called an old woman it's in the name Katie no no believe in equality and I believe everyone is the same age that's not what equality means you have to women are my same age oh my God what about your parents how old were they when they had you I Christ Katie what else can you see pretty much everything baldness for example so Bruce Willis is he is he he's famously bald Kitty why are you doing okay I just want to be able to do and say whatever I want whatever I want and I don't want to have to think about the world's problems actually sounds pretty good I mean I guess I can understand that good way to live that's witnessed in a nutshell um it's also liberal teleology in a nutshell remember liberalism has no endogenous theory of violence right violence always comes from the the specific subjects not the idealized subject the universal subject is one without violence and race in class and and oppression it is one that is rising above and that will naturally lead to a better way of thinking this idea of progress right so she's bound up in that idea of progress because that idea of progress leaves all those questions behind specifically those questions for those in positions of authority and power that don't want to address right they don't ask it so this is denial this idea that we are a country without a history of racism we use American um kind of politics and because Canada Jim Crow 2 and our railroads and all the rest of it we use American experiences of the plantation system to deny the ways in which there were slaves deployed in Canada there were different ways in which we have always and continue to to undertake forms of racist depression right and so this idea of it is then we always want to particularize racism because liberalism can't theorize it right it can't come up with a concept of it doesn't know where it comes from it comes from culture history experience and the idealized subject doesn't have that they're Universal right and so what always ends up happening is we always say they're a bad apple they are a specific individual actor the original expression is the Bad Apple spoils the brunt Bunch which is to say that having one bad actor makes all the others bad but we misread that aphorism in order for it to just mean that there's only one and it's not systemic right we intentionally that is a form of ignorance itself an intentional misreading of the concept in which we are articulating in order to deny the existence of something we don't want to deal with because white people are uncomfortable thinking about their subject position they get defensive in Anger fear and guilt and we want this idealized egalitarian version of liberal democracy because we don't have to deal with the ways in which it's not not it's simply not that's not in history or practice the actual experience of how this thing works and so we like the idealized and political science to the extent that we're largely caught specifically political sciences cut between political theory and practice um we were caught in the middle of kind of doing politics where we're constantly doing this stuff and so this denial is at the heart of of liberalism this denial of the idea that we're articulating Universal rights but from fallible people who make mistakes and so the we're just denying the fallible people that make mistakes in order to understand well that's the goal the goal is that right this active creation of privilege in the choice of knowledge the active misreading of the Bad Apple aphorism this active misreading of things that Canada has less racism in the U.S that somehow the American exceptionalism that they use to argue we are the beacon on the hill we are the the Apex of liberal democracy and capitalism Canada uses to then argue we are even better than them because we don't have the racist past right um which is just an active denial of of reading history and so races uh denialism is especially strong among dominant social group political leaders and the leaders of police forces and institutions because those institutions are going to reflect social hierarchy that they want to at their premise argue as egalitarian but in practice are absolutely not um and so this is the problem over and over again so I'll just use the example of this of the Canada U.S distinction and I'm going to use it in a way that specifically exemplifies the ways in which kind of whiteness is deployed and hierarchical and doesn't even have to be deployed elsewhere to reflect the differences between account and the U.S so there's an article from 2015 it's not required reading in any way but it just exemplifies how Canada the U.S utilize these Concepts differently um when we think about mental health we think about it in a specific way now but in the past specifically around the turn of the century in the 1900s it was framed in terms of mental hygiene and so like development is Improvement mental health has its history and mental hygiene which is dominant groups deciding which characteristics and behavior are permissible and then institutionalizing in a literal sense those bodies that don't conform to their norms and so this is the professionalization of medical experts and medical experts like education like science like political science is supposed to reflect these Universal valueless truths but in practice they're deployed and they're deployed differently in Canada than the US they reflect different historical cultural institutional contexts they have different understandings of what childhood is about who is responsible but how responsibility happens and so Canada's emphasis is on social reform and America's emphasis is on individual reform so from the out set they have different cultural Traditions Canada us look very similar have very similar paths very similar settlement strategies very similar deployments of race and racism but we are still able to distinguish them differently and this results in all sorts of of differences and so the American emphasis is on professional scientific understanding fixing of the individual and it becomes this issue and this is there is no answer to this question about the idea of mental health as being individual or systemic they are correlated and so at the turn of the century everyone on both sides of the border is reading the same journals and they're both trying to develop the same professional culture but the Americans do it in a very specific way they take medical professionals and say we're doing it scientifically because science and reason is the best thing and the Canadians say no no we're doing this in the interest of Canadians so we're doing it socially we're doing group think and so they focus specifically on immigrant immigrant children from mental hygiene and they only have 30 percent medical profession Nationals whereas the US has 60 percent so the U.S deploys a very specific understanding of Science and expertise and Canada deploys science student expertise in a lesser way that's sublimated to the Canadian political Elite and prominent citizens so in this case Canada's exceptionalism then produces these weird outcomes so America produces in terms of its mental hygiene a focus on the biological foundations of difference because they're doing science right they want to find the thing that proves everything they want to look at a social construct and try to figure out where it comes from biologically as if that's capable as if they can do one without the other and so it looks at at individuals characteristics and it tries to establish a norm which it then opposes on everybody else so it looks at genetic inheritance very much in the American model of this Plantation model about reproduction about bodies about finding the problem in the genetic traditions and the failure to be a good Americans is a genetic defect not a migration defect whereas Canada routinely as a result of this produces this political framing about the ways in which there are the problems of mental health come from the community in which they were imported from that they uh their migration is the problem of their mental health and hygiene that we need to focus on the group the production of Canadian sensibilities Canadian nationalities and those groups that don't conform to that are deviant this was the language because they don't conform to our Norms that we have created publicly using some medical officials but mostly Elites and the dominant groups and so the idea of mental health then is solving public problems that originate not in the anglo-white classes of the higher up and Canadian society and so this idea then is is produced in this kind of absurdity this is an example of this absurdity so this is from the Canadian Journal of mental hygiene in 1920 and so it targets somebody who is a problem and in this case it's an Australian woman and this Australian woman then back to the idea of the categories of race and class is uh categorized in this way because of her actions so she was married two years ago after one week's acquaintance as if that has something to do with her mental health and hygiene that these markers about what puts you in the category are totally arbitrary she has since lived with other men is now pregnant and syphilitic so this is a constant concern is this idea of the reproduction of the group she's pregnant uh I assume I guess out of her marriage with other men um and so for like she hopes for a divorce remember because the state has to mediate whether or not you can get divorced to enable her to marry a much man much older than herself oh my goodness how would the state should be concerned with it the medical community should be concerned with this unless she constantly runs uh unless constantly watched she runs the street with immoral intent this is the foundation upon which we can categorize these people as requiring the resources of the state in order to institutionalize because they are mental hygiene problems and then the diagnosis is there I'm not gonna like these are words that were used as if they were scientific and medical even though they reflected the hierarchy of the group status now we will come back to the ways in which I I you know if you're a liberal you believe that we have progressed I we can just talk about you know all of the problems that we have still to this day in terms of policing bodies and specifically policing bodies around all of these questions and you can argue that they've gone away but I've got lots of evidence maybe I'll skip ahead to just show you this evidence that this is a Perpetual problem that we are still doing to this day that was 2018 and this I took from 2021 and then you can just look up the hashtag birth alerts if you really want to get into the the mess of how these ideas about the role of Canadian institutions policing the bodies about what is the next population are still based in all these coded ways of hierarchy and status that are heavily racialized
