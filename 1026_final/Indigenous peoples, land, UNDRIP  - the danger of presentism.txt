 okay um we are now shifting to discussing um identities and so in discussing identities I'm not really sure what this chapter is about it says those things um I'm not convinced that's actually what it's about for a whole bunch of different reasons um I I I'm interested in this topic um I I like discussing this topic I like writing about this topic um so I I have a lot here I'm engaged I'm trying to do my best to to synthesize it it's impossible right it's a big big broad issue um and so I'm I want to have it be more engaging because I think it is an engaging issue so um in terms of of thinking about this chapter then we're drawing on these traditions and I think it's doing the same thing as the last chapter which is why actually I don't think it's about indigenous people at all so what we're talking about here is the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous people U.N drip um we'll discuss the centrality of land and land use and settler colonialism okay uh defining to discuss extractivism sure uh Trace different strategies of indigenous land dispossession um okay and then explain the difference between consultation and consent and sure and identify the tensions in indigenous government relationships this is kind of the reality of what's going on here um we aren't really going to be exploring indigeneity in any substantive way I think that's what indigenous studies does I'm not sure that political science is the the best space to do that our starting assumptions might not be appropriate that doesn't mean we're not going to engage it substantively with these issues it just means that I'm not going to claim Authority that this is doing indigenous studies and I think that's the danger of this chapter just like when we're doing non-western stuff last week this week we're not really doing indigeneity we're doing settler attitudes towards structures that have framed indigenetic right um so what we're really talking about then when we're talking about the centrality of land and land the Houston settler colonialism that's primaries still an extractivist Colonial attitude right um we'll Define and discuss extractivism but again primarily that's about the Western Construction so it's it's like when we're talking about non-western ideas now here we're talking about like a settler relationships with efforts to settle it's very strange uh we'll trace the different strategies of indigenous land dispossession and again that sounds like it's a politics for the leader for the one in charge I'm going to do a bit more of the ways in which we can talk about indigenous mobilization against these processes um explain the difference between consultation and consent sure I I'm not really really what that has to do it's a it's a narrow legal framing of a much broader substantive question about about um what candidate is right and then identified tensions in indigenous government relationship relationships doing a lot of heavy lifting in that um relationship uh implies it implies a whole bunch of things I I don't know why we wouldn't use hierarchy or oppression or resistance or um resilience whatever word you want we just don't use that here so there's a problem that's all who's built in well I've got lots of for me the main thing is that I have tons of serious content the danger with this framing of serious content is that it's not it reproduces the kind of the the patterns of politics of where politics happens and who gets to speak and how they get to speak and it doesn't adequately reflect what's going on this is very similar to I'll unpack I've got lots of funny videos on land acknowledgment and the idea that what ends up happening this with with women this is called the double bind and then increasingly the triple bind when they're when um women's experience is originalized or forms of marginalization in this case what we're doing is like expecting indigenous communities to do the work of unpacking settlement or we utilize them as in ways to do that which is kind of absurd and so I've got easy ways to to deal with this I mean this is taika watiti those are all the things he's done including Thor love and thunder and I can't speak about reservation dogs enough because it is the type of stuff that we need to be thinking about which is the existence of patterns of the past and the present co-contaminantly so we've been talking about these these Legacy of Greek ideas um for that show it's dealing with the legacies of long-standing ideas in the present uh but does it fun in a funny way um humor is often the capability of those who exist in a majority Community but as minority groups so um there's a long tradition of of comedy and comedians because they can participate and see from the outside the absurdity of the participation so humor tells us a lot about the experiences of of marginalized communities um and so that's and this is why punching up and punching down are not the same and it's wide fascist humor doesn't really exist okay um it's just uh forms of racism uh anyways let's let's go with taikova TD here stop asking us what to do how things all right so tired of this I'm so tired I'm so tired of this the diversity conversation inclusivity conversation all the conversations all of us want to be working and not having to come and do [ __ ] panels and speeches on the middle of our day this is a great thing it's good that we're talking about it we have to keep talking about it but this is the [ __ ] you got us doing you wonder why there's no indigenous stuff out there this is the [ __ ] all right making us come and talk about the problem and tell you how to fix it you [ __ ] broke it you fix it if I can ask us what to do someone coming into your house killing all your [ __ ] and burning your house down and then saying okay we need to have a talk about this and then saying now you're going to rebuild your house me and what can we give you to help you rebuild your house that we burnt down you build the [ __ ] house you burned it down and if you don't get together then we'll try again so it's this I this very clear idea that what we're talking about is often not about um the experiences of indigenous people so we're talking about identity but we're not actually talking about indigenous people per se we're talking about settler attitudes towards indigenous people and that indigenous experiences are quite different um and this is I mean reservation dogs this this stems from the there's a comedy group that that taekwatiti coordinated and that they developed this show it's on Disney Plus foreign [Music] looks as though you've tasted the white man's lead it's only paintballs I've had many brothers and sisters meet the same Fate In My Time are you crazy horse or sitting no no no I'm not one of those awesome guys no I'm more of your uh I'm more of your unknown Warrior yeah you know my name William nice man I was at the Battle of Little Bighorn that's right I didn't kill anybody but I fought bravely well I didn't actually fight I actually didn't even get into the fight itself but I came over that Hill real rugged like I saw a custard like that that yellow hair he was sitting there Son Of The Morning Star that guy right there [ __ ] I really hated him so I went after him but then the damn horse hit a gopher hole [ __ ] rolled over and squashed me I died there this horse actually a little [ __ ] and now I'm meant to travel the spirit world find lost souls like you the spirit world it's cold my nipples are always hard I'm always hungry got it being a warrior it's not always easy you and you Dougie asked friends what are you doing for your people it's easy to be bad it's hard to be a warrior with dignity remember that in my time we gave everything we died for our people we died for our land what are you gonna do what are you going to fight for I just [ __ ] with you but for real though listen to what I said marinate on it I hope let's go uh good times so it's not about thinking about the past it's about framing things through the present and so and this is just I mean this is very abstract this is largely my formulation you don't need to worry too much about this but this helps us explain the binaries we keep talking about in the western tradition is that Greek thought organizes through opposition self either good evil male female mind body and so it incorporizes it incorporates difference through knowledge and this is what we talked about last time with the university being a source of authority over knowledge is a way of appropriating the experiences of others and then presenting them to benefit the academy the west and those who are experts and so this has always been a problem in studying indigenous communities is that the West the and the Anthropologist the researcher takes those experiences that they find there the insights they find there and then make them for themselves and so this has been happening over time and this is these colonizing practices of knowledge production so I'll talk about this in the context of or colonialism in a bit I would say there's all different ways of doing it one of the reasons that I'm focused on anti-Semitism throughout the course is that this this organization through indifference or between Believers non-believers ethics and reasons um we don't have to get into too much this stems from from habermust but uh or not habermas um uh it doesn't matter the idea of organization through practice is lebanos sorry organization through practices and this specifically that you can convert into Judaism and that we there's this relationship between Judaism and through the right of return the ability to get citizenship but the idea here is that the indifference of the Hebrew Faith to the idea of what others is doing is fundamentally different than the the conversion of a Christianity right and so indigenous practices is then organized through relation uh oral tradition this idea that you're repeating the stories of the past but making them your own this kind of imminent Foundation of this the historical basis of the present and so that is a funny Disney Plus show in Canada dealing with a bunch of kids who live on a reserve but are dealing with contemporary modern issues at the same time they're dealing with his the historical is always present whereas we like to especially with revolutionary and and um uh breaking thought you know the West always wants to wipe everything out and start anew wipe it out start a new wipe it out and start anew so it lacks that historical president so the idea here is that it's a dialogical relationship that indigenous traditions in this isn't in general but more often than not can coexist with multiple cultures and traditions which we don't have and so there's ways in which like this gets replicated in how we think about things all the words that we use that stem directly from these issues now those words stemming from the issues is the way that the West immediately colonizes ideas appropriates those ideas and forgets about them I don't haven't developed it enough yet I've got a couple articles on it but like whiteness is a form of forgetting that that's really what whiteness is it's a forgetting of tradition of passive of history in order to set Anew and set in a kind of naive ignorant way about these the places in which we are and so this idea is that that the languages we use and the way in which we use them help us structure our relationship to what we know and how we can know it these ideas in which we have languages that are Concepts that are inherently racist these codes I mean famously the code break workers in World War II I think it was the Lakota were using indigenous languages as code that couldn't be understood so even if they broke the code in World War II they didn't understand the the language and they didn't have the context history metaphors and and understanding so they even if they got the language they didn't understand the language themselves and so we have this Persistence of of language as a form of representation this is the National Congress of American Indians did the did this campaign specifically about the use of racist mascots that they've now been renamed to the Guardians to show how offensive it is that these communities and they still exist all over the place indigenous ways of being are represented but they're represented in a way that is really about settlers and not about indigeneity and so this is still persistent in sports teams like we're just dealing with we just got rid of the Washington racial slurs as a mascot that was during covid right like this stuff is so present it's ever present but at the same time the West always frames it as past and it's not past because people have to live this experience and so that's what we're going to get into today to avoid the framing of this as historical and therefore something to worry about a long time ago and see that the ways in which it's it's kind of constantly present and so I'm not sure this is about indigeneity per se I think it's more about settler attitudes towards indigenity
