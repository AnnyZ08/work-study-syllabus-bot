 okay Welcome to our discussion of political ecology um so yeah we skipped a couple chapters here because honestly the chapters were very good they were very abstract um and so I really felt like those the political order and the um ipe chapters would have been very abstract and not very useful and we we've got more specific examples here and then I just added a topic it it could rotate year to year but the idea being we just put nuclear in this year I guess you know um Oppenheimer coming out some some you know way of framing these issues so this chapter again you know we have the base text but I'm going to add quite a bit to it because we don't have any examples we need examples um so we're going to develop this idea of political ecology um and my kind of take on what what they mean by that um they're going to try to talk about how it transforms the discipline of political science I mean everybody says that look it's shiny and new provide examples of the way political ecology understand issues sure uh critical ecological issues sure and engage political ecologists okay so uh political ecology is a newcomer to political scientists um I don't think that's actually true I think there's a long history and tradition of people engaging with these things critically I think this is a narrow reading of political sciences science and I also think it's constructivist which is to say it wants to say things are constructed but again it needs to supplement its normative framework and we'll see that it runs in the same problem as as we ran with into like with constructivism before this one is more post-structural but it's it's still the same issue um absolutely this is a an issue that's at the Forefront of everything so I do think it could be a framework for understanding I just don't know if it's the best way to conceptualize these issues because of the problems that we'll talk about in a second um so the textbook talks about how the idea um of of these issues are coming forward and political science isn't very well equipped to deal with them and I agree all right uh climate refugees and migrants are going to be an issue I'll talk a bit about that um the idea of environmental justice so moving beyond Justice as a kind of adjudication between just I don't know humans in terms of crimes or intergenerational or those type of things will go to a broader framework and then food democracy I'll talk a bit about and we've already talked about extractivism so I don't think we need to get too much into that um and so the idea here is that political ecology as as a you know the method masquerading as a theory it's trying to say that it doesn't displace the core concerns of political science such as class gender race sexuality State institutions interests and Norms it brings the ecological relationships in and provides multiple axes of analysis okay but what are you doing right we don't really have a good sense of that there are ways in which people are doing things but I'm not sure that this political ecology approach is making it clear what the conflict is the conflict between humans and the environment or is the conflict between humans who conceptualize themselves outside the environment or inside the environment right we don't know um and so part of what it's doing here is saying that and I agree with this the idea that political science has as traditionally undervalued and not actually thought about conceptually um the biophysical world as separate from human interest and concern and so when we're talking about cycles of reproduction regeneration chemical and physical Dynamics these things happen regardless of whether or not humans are here and so the conceptualization then is that if those things are happening then is the human intervention separate from those things or part of those things and so this is the the concept of the anthropocene I'll talk a bit about um it's this framework of where should we fit humans in in this web of social relationships so traditionally because of the long history of both monotheism and the abrahamic tradition and the Western World and this doesn't apply to and I'll I've got examples with the heart and Ashanti of the ways in which we don't have to privilege ourselves above but we could be alongside anyways we have in the past privileged ourselves as above the natural world um and so this creates all sorts of problems if we want to displace that so if we want to say that humans are just alongside all the biological processes in the world it raises an immediate logical problem because if humans are part of the natural world then what they're doing is natural even if it's resulting in the destruction of the natural world because as in this framework in the anthropocene framework humans represent an extinction level event we are just the next one we are the next meteoroid that's hitting the Earth and wiping out stuff and whatever lives after it will continue to live of and so this is the problem of this this it they try to I guess what they're trying to do with the political ecology thing is convince us that this is like a it's an important approach but it's not radical but if we take it to its logical outcomes this is quite radical and so this is the idea of of um whether or not we can actually choose Extinction and so I don't know this is a un thing with Jack Black talking about this idea [Music] you okay you need a minute cool listen up people I know a thing or two about Extinction and let me tell you and you kind of think this would be obvious going extinct is a bad thing and driving yourselves extinct in 70 million years that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard at least we had an asteroid what's your excuse you're headed for a climate disaster and yet every year governments spend hundreds of billions of public funds on fossil fuel subsidies imagine if we had spent hundreds of billions per year subsidizing giant meteors that's what you're doing right now think of all the other things you could do with that money around the world people are living in poverty don't you think helping them would make more sense than I don't know paying for the demise of your entire species let me be real for a second you've got a huge opportunity right now as you rebuild your economies and bounce back from this pandemic this is Humanity's big chance so here's my wild idea don't choose extinctions save your species before it's too late it's time for you humans to stop making excuses and start making changes thank you [Music] thank you I mean so this is the question that we have is when we talk about scales we like to think about humans as the having the capacity to choose based on the current evidence we don't have a ton of evidence that people are going to choose the right path to Stave off coming problems I'm not sure we have any historical evidence that people choose the right path they probably don't have the time scale to understand themselves in context or environment we live in a time scale that's relatively well it's defined by our own lifespan and maybe those of our those who came before us and immediately after us but we have very little memory of two and three and four generations ago when so when you're talking about a 70 million year time span it's not at all clear that like individual choice is going to matter very much so the problem here is that when we think about political ecology they're they're taking in a specific way to try and frame it as it's obvious that these are these situations I'm not sure it is so sure the social natural worlds are co-determining each other in the past we've seen it as the social World determines the natural world right um the idea of you using scale is this idea that that these are big time scales we're talking about 70 million years is very different than you know humans moving this all of this way in a very quick time scale um it's interdisciplinary sure we you know not there isn't one field that can deal with climate change issues it's it's all of them um reworks theoretical approaches maybe I'm not really sure and I'm not sure how because again I don't know like are we saying that people aren't going to choose Extinction are you convincing them is do we have evidence that that's the case we have lots of evidence that there's climate change denialism right so which one wins out like we hope that we choose it but I'm not sure that we can right like I'm sure we have enough evidence to to support that position so um it has an explicit normative commitment I'm not sure what this means or which ones and takes a post-positive approach now this I kind of agree with it kind of not positivism in case you don't know is just the idea that there's an objective reality that we can measure and test and verify using often quantitative methods quantitative things that could be measured that have a value associated with it which is okay except when it comes to climate change it's hard right because it's it's at a scale that we can't reduce to easy numbers and so it's not at all clear like that we're not dealing with a qualitative problem and we're coming at it with quantitative framings right and so post positivism then acknowledges multiple realities and the role is subjectivity so Us in in the system not just looking at the system without us in it and I feel that that's what that video is doing it's saying hey look the problem's out there we can fix it in here and then make it work out there well we're probably in in it allows for Theory generation and qualitative exploration and uses a broader range of methods sure so it tries to because if you're dealing with stories and subjective it's not clear and so the problem is the central one which is are these little subjective one in eight billion can one in eight billion make good decisions for the 8 billion or would they make with the decisions for the one and so just because something socially interpreted doesn't mean it's unreal climate change is greenhouse gas emissions causes illness because some species go extinct ecosystems can absorb stress tropical Force disappearing um you know it's this constant Foundation of political dispute and so when we come and here's the positivist problem at the outset this has been the case over and over again is that as this video talk about climate refugees don't exist they don't exist not because it's not a problem that that is going to happen it's that our current framework legal framework and understanding for refugees requires political persecution for them to claim Refugee status otherwise they're just you know forced migrants or some form of migration and so we haven't even set up the framework to do this in part because we can't determine individual responsibility for climate change we can't say that Canada has contributed directly to this person leaving this place in which case we will not establish legal and political responsibility for the relationship again between the political outcome and the citizens who caused it so we can absolutely say that like we're contributing to global climate change as percentages as you know CO2 production but we can't prove any with any correlative Foundation that it was you know this straw that you threw out that led to the sea turtle getting it stuck of its nose and so we have these these issues at the center it does not actually exist in international law a refugee is defined as a person who has crossed an international border defined by the 1951 Convention as owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion and crossing a border Island country's borders yeah 80 pound scenes in Australia offer a glimpse into the future bushfires have been burning since September dozens of people have died forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria have been raised some blazes were so monstrous they created their own weather patterns causing dried lightning and fire tornadoes we have an autistic mini extreme event it was floods that have impacted routes that have impacted people around the world in terms of migration of people it's entirely possible large parts of Australia will be uninhabitable in the decades to count even the Prime Minister appears to be changing his stance and acknowledging the climate crisis as a national initiative we would I think want to have a higher level of confidence that as a nation we are improving our resilience and our adaptation to respond to the reality of the environment in which we live okay resilience and adaptation are both other euphemisms for we might do something but we're not sure we're going to do that much um so this is a problem then if we can't prove in a way that's going to establish a political like even if you have all the data in front of you you people deny data all the time right the rhetoric takes over from the reason and this tension that we've seen throughout the course is that just because there's reasonable evidence doesn't mean people are going to politically choose it right um and so ideas like food democracy great I sure radical transform our social organization we know that Farmers Feed cities that we are you know 98 of us are dependent on the two percent that produce this stuff the problem is is that we've created systems for example that that four companies based in the U.S control over 80 percent of the world's Seed Market 25 of agrochemical Market I've got this too I didn't include it in this lecture but you can look at almost every major food production industry is largely concentrated in the hands of a big company so we want to have food democracy but you're talking like what what are you saying are you saying socialism communism back to those questions fascism eco-fascism like I don't know what the argument is here six corporations hand it handle 85 percent of World Trade and grain 15 between the 95 percent of the coffee sales and the farm subsidies like built into this framework are Farm subsidies for the EU and USA which then have to compete elsewhere in the world and the easiest way to compete elsewhere in the world is to literally a burn down uh trees turn it into Farmland so you've got something that you've got like in the Amazon for example you've got all of this space that you can just raise in order to create Farmland in order to convert that Farmland into meat and so we've seen this we don't have any evidence that since 61 that's the growth of meat consumption by region meat production and consumption it's shooting up all over the place and so the the soy that is used to feed cows is the primary driver of what's happening to the Amazon so it's our food systems are the ones that are doing this and they're heavily concentrated so if they're concentrated we don't get a say in it it's up to those actors and and the states who regulate them in order to do this on top of that it's not at all clear that we're efficient with our food um the there's a religion handbook on food waste and if you go back over the kind of anthropo anthropological record humans have never been good at at saving food we throw out listen when it was small scale it makes a certain amount of sense okay if you throw out food waste it goes into the ground other animals eat it blah blah goes back into the ecosystem so when we were you know when our population was in the millions it might not have had as much environmental impact but when we're talking about billions and we're talking about this massive increase in all of that food is is made with energy massive increase in energy consumption to to feed eight billion people and then we throw out about a a third of all the food that we grow you're talking about huge impact tax on the environment that are not being made by a collective decision per se they're being made by eight billion individuals making food choices and so I don't think you want and I I don't have any evidence that you are supporting governments imposing veganism on everybody you're still making an individual choice and so we're not sure that individual choices are the best ways to deal with these Collective action problems and it's not clear that this framework or any framework is going to address that tension between the individual choice and the collective outcome
