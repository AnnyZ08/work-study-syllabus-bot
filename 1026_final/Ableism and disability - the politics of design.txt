 so I'm just going to include the link rather than watch it through with you on this one there's a fundamental politics of design that underpins all of the questions of the social right one of the interesting things about China's growth has been the emergence of a consumer middle class has also meant the massive construction of infrastructure um all right there's many examples of this at one point I think China was putting up a um a multiplex like movie theater a week um you know this this example of a a construction firm erecting a 57 stories skyscraper in 19 days the speed of this design is built in to the ways in which they're building infrastructure so in 12 years that's the the rail and high-speed infrastructure that China was able to build um versus the problems that come from that you may be able to do it fast and this is one of the complaints over and over again about um development and infrastructure in Canada I don't have a good answer for this again I think it's like the the farcamon thing um having the capacity to build things like infrastructure High-Speed Rail is absolutely good for the environment it's public transit it's what everybody needs it's what people who are differently able can absolutely use rather than everybody being required to have cars which is kind of how Canada's been built and there's the video after this explains that um also think about it in terms of environments that these types of design can be green because they're consciously thought to do so so the impetus for a lot of the public infrastructure in China is to try to get it off of dirty energy or forms of energy that are more sustainable reliable or Dependable whatever so that is thinking green but it's thinking green in a kind of self-centered way we'd have to think green here too but we have to do things like environmental assessments then we have to have Community input then we have to have things like accessibility then we have to have things like um uh impact assessments and open debate rates and forums and the ways in which we discuss all of these questions the idea of us doing all those things is so that we will get something that is closer to a Universal Design when we build infrastructure but it's slow and so the question becomes what do you value when we're thinking about building things and so the video below is is going to talk about um it's more specifically about the ways in which um small groups have led to the design of Suburbia in particular which is ecologically a nightmare in terms of Social Services really hard and in terms of ability very difficult as well in my neighborhood here one of the choices that was made was no sidewalks so no sidewalks in subdivisions as a way on one side of the road at bare minimum sometimes on neither side as a way to keep the costs down in terms of tax base and for the municipality but that's short-term thinking in terms of livability and now we're in the circumstances where I mean I've talked to our counselor many times about this um they're stuck they can't make the changes because at the outset they design for cheap and fast and now they want to have livable and can't do that you've got to redesign design or you've got to move or you've got to change things and so the idea of the individualization of these issues is not an individual issue they're about the extent to which we think these issues from the outset and so that's what the politics is doing of this week is to say can you think about these things when you speak when you uh design when you make claims and when you talk about representation because are you actually representing these groups when you make some type of claim or are you just reinforcing ideas and so everybody knows like the TTC might getting my mom in and out to Toronto we have to get my sister to meet her at at the Go stations because go is okay but TTC is a nightmare for people who are visually visually impaired um and so this idea of um disability as the reason that people don't travel it's no it's because they can't reliably like I was talking to my mom the other day she just said once she knows where the the things are at the station then she can function out there but the design of every station is so distinct because they want to express the the community for people who need things to be in the same place it doesn't work it makes it harder it makes it more difficult and so framing disability is the reason that people don't travel is blaming somebody for us that have said yes screw you um and so this idea then of obstacles like washrooms and seats are just kind of Basics that if you don't think about and they're not there they won't do it um access icons but no washrooms right things things like that and so that's the politics of design video I'll just put it in the the playlist um because it's long and I don't have a whole lot to contribute it's just something interesting um to think about when we're thinking about infrastructure what kind of infrastructure are we building who are we building it for and what are the costs associated with it
