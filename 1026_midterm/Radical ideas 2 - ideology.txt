 so maybe I will come down in this next discussion and maybe not go as long but uh we'll see um so the shift then from ideas to ideologies has to do with the ways in which ideas are accepted by the public are necessarily accepted by the public if you're in a monarchical system it doesn't really matter what the people think the people can think whatever they want so long as they don't Rebel right things that organize them or make them rebellious well that's a problem and so this concept of ideology really emerges alongside the French Revolution because you have the people involved in governance um it's you know the systemic study and organization of ideas and Concepts and the the first ideologues were those ideas of the French Revolution translators everybody just understood what was going on right these are why we're doing these things it's a necessary outcome in a democratic system um we had this did this happen so Canada didn't have an indefinite independent foreign policy in World War One um so it was still set by the British remember as I said everyone who fought and died in World War one and two in Canada did so under the British enson and so one of the problems was that we had literal riots in the streets in 1917 when Canada tried to enforce conscription on um the french-speaking population because they're like this is a British war what is going on here and so the old monarchical way of of doing things is just simply ordering our troops into war because we can do so when you required all these sacrifices in world one and World War II you had to expand enfranchisement and you had to get those those people to agree that these wars were good in order for for us to to want to fight in them um and so this idea then is you know ideal biology is first given a bad rap by Napoleon because it allows him to support his conquests and they say like halitosis bad breath that it's always something somebody else has rather than us and so I'd like to ask this question how do ideological are you do you see other people as ideological in political science in particular political science students can be seen as rather ideological um or annoying or insiders right as they're really obsessed with the minutia of the horse racing of who's going to win the election or these types of things as if elections are the same as politics elections are political if you have that definition of politics um but the extent to which they they get to this level of ideology I don't know um they've are probably well-bounded by the liberal Democratic Frameworks in which we can think so um ideology then is is framed as largely a negative concept here um you know marks and Ingles that again I don't know this Marxism as this is not the Marxism I recognize but ideology masks the reality of working class to benefit of the ruling class we'll get into this in a bit when we talk about communism and socialism um I can show you a thousand memes that do a better job explaining Marxism ideology than this but we'll say false consciousness workers are alert into supporting the status quo and interests of the ruling class sure then you want to make it the most simple way that you can do it fine you could do that we can also just say for example um somehow people haven't demanded an increase of the bare minimum wage in the U.S since the 1970s in a way that that's resulted in it actually increasing right um it's an easier way to say the same thing and so unequal power relations in society the detriment of workers and benefit of the ruling class it benefits people in fast food wages to keep them low fast food companies that have billions of dollars of profit do so because we keep the minimum wage low right in a democratic system you would think that the most people would support these things the idea of false consciousness is for whatever reason um through cynicism or constantly voting for someone who turns around and doesn't do the thing they vote for we'll get into this we'll get to populism but this idea of unequal power relation sure let's frame it that way I would say there are more sophisticated understandings um they're lukash has this more sophisticated understanding of this which would have nice to have been in the text but it's not there's lots of things absence from this test what he says is that what's more interesting to think about is that is what people think class or struggle and so this is more interesting than just calling it class struggle what he says is that do people think through their experiences as a form of the ways in which they can challenge their systems of domination and oppression the ways in which I tend to think of all gender as oppressive it oppresses our bodies it says I have to do certain things in certain ways it says I need hormone replacement therapy to still be a real man I need to use steroids if I'm going to be the real real man those type of things that there's always ways in which systems are trying to convince me that I'm supposed to be something and so the question is do I struggle against those or do I see them as part of my identity my class and so the Protestant work ethic is a way of which like if you don't work you are somehow have an individual failing which doesn't make a ton of sense I might get to it later but there's a tick tock in here about how you know farming systems and Indigenous societies required about like 10 hours of Labor to get your food um so somehow it's it's seen as bad not working a 40-hour week all of the innovations that are supposed to increase productivity haven't really reduced the work week we've had some experiments with it France has experimented with it back and forth about okay we've got all these increases in productivity I can make chat GPT do my work for me why am I still working a 40-hour week why is it set at that right and so this Protestant work ethics then is about false consciousness or false ideology as being that the ways in which we believe as individuals the system it's our individual failing is why the system isn't working rather than seeing it the other way around and so we can talk about this the the consumerism as a form of individual volition and idealism So This Is Us identifying with class they did these studies over and over again like most most Americans think there'll be millionaires within the next couple years right like these ideas then that we associate then success and and um worth with being rich and billionaires and so this is our obsession with Kardashians and billionaires they don't see it in terms of struggle they see it in terms of class right nationalism functions for lukash as a rallying the flag it's it's so you can get peasants um conflicting over opposing Flags than fighting about their peasant them right which is a way of saying that that's false consciousness right if you can be like screw that guy who's exactly the same social classes you social experience of you just happens to be on the wrong side of a border um that's a very powerful mechanism and so that's about class and not struggle right or if you want to frame it a struggle then it's about struggle and not class right and so this is a more sophisticated understanding that isn't in our text um we get like a throwaway phrase about about uh grampsia and ideological hegemony um grampsia is very interesting in thinking about this idea of ideology right so if ideology is about class or struggle are you thinking in terms of common shared interests or the ways in which you are being marginalized by systems of Oppression um ideology is used to co-opt potential leaders of the sub-altern groups into these social myths what Sorel called social myths the idea that you're part of a historic block American exceptionalism right like that they're they are against our freedom we have to go get them um you know ask Americans why they went to Iraq right like uh well Saddam had weapons of mass destruction okay you have weapons of mass discretion lots of people have weapons of mass destruction well he was willing to use them okay when maybe um why is that an American problem well because America is the global hegemon we have to do these things okay but you specifically why do you care and so those questions are are linked to the idea of social myths are linked to imperialism democracy genocide we'll talk about genocide later when we talk about fascism um the idea that that somehow though that group is responsible for my problems is the classic kind of definition of the way in which ideology or false consciousness functions throughout brains right um you know these are ways that we prevent reform by saying that like no we're all Americans and Americans don't have to worry about this um the Catholic church had a key role um in in corporatism we'll discuss a bit later of the idea that the Catholic Church says no we don't need class struggle you classes who keep struggling and listening to this Marxism no Marxism is is Godless communism let's let's work together with the state in order to make sure all of the workers um get compensated so they don't Rebel right um and so this is a key aspect to prevent um forms of um radicalism we often look for reform as it right and and the one of the ways we do that is through ideology listen don't don't Rebel and struggle if you vote next time you'll get your thing um and they you know and that oh you voted you didn't get your guy you can next time you vote you get your thing right this type over and over again another key aspect here is that education is a key aspect of ideological control um in grampsia this is the idea of the organic versus traditional intellectuals some people this is what Robert Cox a Canadian political scientist called the difference between problem solving versus critical thinking um I think this binary falls apart sometimes but we like binaries so so this is why we do is that are you trying to fix a thing are you doing problem-based learning are you actually developing ideas right um and so this whole chapter is about I guess they felt that the ethics of teaching about radicalized ideas is because we are in such a dangerous time to not actually engage with radical ideas to to make those radical ideas as banal as possible so we don't get um told that we are being radical or that we're teaching radicalism that we are um you know we should be teaching the status quo and only challenging on the margins we want to produce reformism not radicalism and so ideology then is framed in this framework as as neutral I just scratch that it's reasonable right um I I think there's a difference between these because what happens then is the in this liberal sociological move um it says that it it flattens all of these positions it says they're all equivalents uh they're just ideas they don't have any material basis they don't actually come from system of Oppression they're all just ideas because we live in a society we all experience that Society together and therefore as a society we can understand how groups are formed historically through common belief and values so black lives matter is exactly the same as um as the January 6th stuff we can equate them all they're all just arguing ideas they don't result in violence or outcomes or insurrections or treason nope it's all the same and so this is the idea it's a total conception of ideology that says this is the different ideologies that circulate in a state um and Society is a coherent social whole and it's not about conflict or struggle it's just a conflict of ideas and so once those ideas are are passively transmitted into our brains it's just which ideological formation comes about uh geerts they put in here too gears is is better than this this political reading of geodes is not doing it's a disservice to his anthropology but the idea that ideologies emerge during significant social disruption and political change and you can understand why right because you need to explain social change and political change and groups are going to be either Pro or against them right they'll there'll either be um these are are things we need to do or these are things we need to reject right um and that you know how we make sense of the world when reality is no longer clear and so when there are contestation when things happen we have to interpret those things and so there's this I mean we saw this I'll use the code example here we saw this immediately with the covid with the immediate reaction everybody's like well ah and then over time we get we have to start thinking and critically and developing our ideas about it and what we should do and how we should do and we change our ideas and then people point to the inconsistency of those ideas and say those aren't valid idea makers anymore I'm going to articulate my vision of how this is right um and so I think what is more important from geertz is that he doesn't try to do this analytical stuff that political science tries to do he tries to understand it as situated deeply and detailed in Social context in order to understand how ideas are material and they matter and they are linked to oppression and experiences um he's a structuralist so he says these things matter but we don't get any of that in this chapter so when we think about ideology today um you know the ideology is just framed in the textbook as a key set of beliefs and values that the legitimate a social order they fully recognized there is no agreement in political science and the definition of ideology there are many things like this that because we are studying conflict the boundaries of conflict are always going to be decided by an in-group and out group even in the field so we have the problem-solving thinkers who will frame these issues differently than the critical thinkers so we have 16 different definitions of ideology we'll just use this one and that's what often happens in political analyzes we use an approach not because it's necessarily the best approach but because it it fits to our already preconceived notions or what it is we want to examine or study right um and so there are values of beliefs that oppose or challenge the dominant order so ideology is weird because in theory if it works we should all believe it but it clearly doesn't work so we're constantly believing and not believing things that are said and this idea you know does the the mere existence of non-majorities it challenge the dominant order so we had these weird situations under um under George W bush and Stephen Harper where we set up we actually Canada copied the U.S office of religious freedom so what it did is that it it said that we have to look for the persecution of religious minorities all over the world okay fine but it seemed to focus on Christian minorities and non-Christian states which let's be clear as a minority group they're going to face systems of Oppression but the fact that we target that minority group there as a thing that we're going to dedicate resources to speaks to that original securitizing move that ideology reflects power and interests of dominant groups right and so this political science neutral approach to ideology um says that it examines how ideologies benefit some and disadvantage others I guess kind of but it's not a neutral Approach at all it just is the dominant group saying that those ideas are reasonable and those ideas are not it's how we can get like really wacky stuff on on about politics emerging in the current moment where we have no consensus in the absence of consensus you can get away with making much Wilder claims like the I just keep picking on them the flat earthers you can make much more wild claims because there isn't really a mechanism to make sure that everybody agrees on the same ideas and so this is kind of like a lie about ideology and methods like you'll get to this later if you take political science further in methods courses you pick your your framework and then do your research but your framework itself is ideological it's a positivist framework it's a liberal framework it's a critical framework it's a feminist framework it's a postcolonial framework it's an intersectional analysis it's a you know class-based frame whatever you want those then determine the data you use political data doesn't mean one thing because it's an open system it's not a closed system the science part the science problem again so I'll just leave it there for now but when we're thinking about ideology we have to be critical about how we think about Audiology unlike the textbook
