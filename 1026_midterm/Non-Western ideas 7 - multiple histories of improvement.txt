 so at this point Palestine is becoming a kind of meme for me of the way which I've avoided talking but um anyways so um what we're talking about with the subaltern speaking is is the idea of the ways in which there are efforts to think about overlapping forms of oppressor marginalization so much so that we can't even hear these voices at all um and so the idea here is that we we need to attach the ethno to non-western ideas um not because what we're talking about African philosophy is ethno philosophy but all philosophy is ethno philosophy right and at the same time ethno doesn't necessarily tell us very much at all it probably tells us about which hierarchies are are playing themselves out in these forms of thought um but that's fine I mean all all thought there's a capacity to be able to to think and speak and that is privilege and that privilege needs to be recognized we just have to acknowledge where it comes from in order for us to criticize we can't see something we can't criticize we can't talk about it because it's not there and so the idea um of the dive ignoring the diversity of thought and that there are better alternatives are out there um is largely this framing of well we've done all we can do and we can't think about these things and so the idea here is that at dealing with multiple modernities is to say that there are different paths proposed elsewhere none of them are going to be the path because it's never clear why we would have only one um and we know this is okay slow so talk about the history of development um the history of improvement um and it's it's fundamental we've been through I think six different models at this point um it's still a heavily contested concept we don't have any metrics or standards by which we would say um absolutely this is the path because clearly as I talked about earlier in the course like China's communist capitalist thing has been the best marker of moving people from from peasant status to middle class status that we have in terms of sheer numbers right um and so this weird notion about modernity then is about modernity has been equated to westernization which is doesn't need to be the case even a little bit there are innovations that happen all over the place all throughout history that have been borrowed from and forgotten in the western Canon and that these experiences continue to to happen right people are still continuing to think there so we'll get to this when we talk about Iran but um the idea that that different Frameworks synthesize ideas from different so China's uh Mao and the Little Red Book is taking Marxism and situating it in the Chinese context um even you know Russia does this it takes Marxism and situations in a context British Marxism takes it situated in context um North American Marxism is largely purged through red scares um and and blackballing and all the rest of it and so they all have very specific understandings and that's why this the refusal to think the ideal last week no we have to think the ideal and then understand how it's always interpreted right it's always contingent someone's always making it as a claim when they make it as a claim it's going to change the way in which it functions right which I mean if we didn't rely on the text so much we would understand um in the oral Traditions the oral Traditions are inherently subjectivizing these texts and we can do this in in Hebrew Traditions too or very interesting thinking about the ways in which the word is repeated and recited and the texts are interpreted and and the interpretation of the text is is important in and of itself interpretation matters because it's you doing the work in the present of thinking the past thinking the word through your own mind right and so I I think there's a value in taking handwritten notes right we've got data that shows that there's a value in doing it I can chat GPT all these notes and stick them in the the descriptions of all these videos but it's just text then you have to work through the text for it to to Lodge in your your brain and so what we work through lodges right and so history shouldn't be thought of as a linear development process with a singular future European thought should be placed in its own contexts and one context will not apply to other contexts right um specifically this this reading talks about this the kind of the struggles framing the history of development as a history of conflict whereby there have been struggles all along so this is Gord Hill this is a one of the comic books I have that just talks about and what it's doing is basically saying um for for indigenous kids who read this they will just not have to read that there's a single model of development that was applied without conflict that resulted in beneficial outcomes it's a way of saying to kids no we always resisted this this has never been ours this model doesn't apply to us and and we haven't done that and so reading history as a resistance to single monolithic understandings of the world is an important contribution right and so here we'll have them talk about it May every single example of how historians could actually intervene in public debates and shape so you know I mean just to put you give you the gist of Henry's early work and two or three sentences so he was the first person who claimed that Australia was not one peaceful from the Aboriginal people so he documented over the 19th century some 100 instances of small and big Aboriginal Wars of resistance resisting white people's occupation of the land and he according to his counting he said at least twenty thousand if I remember the figure right Australian aboriginals died resisting white occupation and his argument was that because Australia was taken over unlike in Canada U.S or in New Zealand without signing a treaty or treaties with Aboriginal groups aboriginals had never he argued legally seeded their sovereign argument in public life was that Australia was an illegal Nation that white Australia had no legal basis and you can imagine the kind of debate it would give rise to it therefore he was arguing that I can prove as a history that there's no legal basis to the nation because you didn't sign the treaty and therefore you should now sign a treated retrospectively giving acknowledging as it were the first Nations rights on the nation and on the land through a treat now that treaty was never a sign but but this was a remarkable instance of an intelligent history and taking advantage of certain of certain legal mythologies demolishing some which was that the demolishing the myth that Australia was occupied because it was still an earliest nobody there was no humans there empty land he demolished that maybe but he also tried to argue that if you took somebody else's land without them agreeing then if taken the land by Conquest and the nation founded on Conquest doesn't have a modern legal basis as a nation so this idea of modernity and legal basis is is about reading using history and just reading the details in order to understand the ways in which there's multiple tracks of history and that dominant groups rewrite history this is the case I always use the example um the 1763 Royal Proclamation uh of uh King George said that um if you can understand why said that there can be no treaties entered into without the agreement of The Sovereign King because you don't want settlers running ahead and meeting indigenous groups and saying I'm entering it into treaty so I can have your territory because then that would lead to chaos right you'd have multiple conflicting game claims and so indigenous groups could only enter into agreements with the crown the problem is is that places in British Columbia never had this happen they started settling they settled as forts you can go all throughout Canada look at where the forts are that these never happened and so when we like to talk about the idea of an illegal occupation or unseated territory we like to think about it out there but it's long been the case that this has been a problem I think in Vancouver City Council acknowledged this a couple years ago that that this is kind of an illegal occupation by our own standard this is our own Constitution so so 1763 Royal Proclamation is recognized in the 1982 Canadian Charter and in the charter it's very clear that that nothing in the charter abrogates the obligations under that and so our own constitutional structures challenge the legitimacy of our statehood and so part of the reading of History then is about reading the ways in which practices fight against the idealization of Oh Canada is a settled Sovereign territory everything's fine right if we want to be constitutionally sound we have to look at the specifics and read the specifics and so that's the insights that he's talking about there is just this notion of History not being a linear development progress process and that history itself can be used as a kind of strategy to think about the ways in which the concepts that are being deployed aren't even accurate on their face
