 okay so let's engage with the last of the ideas chapters from the textbook um this one's non-western ideas which I mean that's that's something um so you know we have to be part of the reason so let's be clear the textbook I was using the past uh was was you know this one's much much better even for all my criticisms last week of it it's much much better um because the last one I had was was literally a Catholic textbook um for whatever reason uh so this one is good in that it's dealing with um non-western ideas so what we're going to look at is you know the ways in which non-western ideas are as diverse as those uh of of the non-western world anyways um we'll discuss orientalism um and then how we think about that will provincialize a lot of what we're doing this week is provincializing which is basically saying like I I discussed last week you know was World War II an ethnic conflict if we frame it as an ethnic conflict it's provincializing the ways in which their attitudes opinions and culture within what where are the rise claim to be Sovereign Nation States right um and so um this idea of on the one hand kind of ethnicizing or culturally situating the experience of the West and also deculturing the ideas of the East the South whatever you wanted to call it and we'll go through all the problems of this language thing um and then we'll talk about glocal which is the the inter-penetration of the local and the global so it's kind of direct mediation of the you know what we call the global level and then the kind of Municipal local level and then the idea of production of critical thinking throughout this section so already like this is weird first it's that it's chapter five so it's the last of the ideas so we want to we want to say that we're taking these ideas seriously but we put them at the back um there's also not a substantive discussion of I think women's ideas from the non-western world here which is weird we've got Spivak but we don't have a ton of others um and then you know this idea that ideas travel across times and places and shaped by other ideas context and power relations okay I I have some questions about how these ideas move across space and time right so that like it's not always done voluntarily right and that this travel is often linked to imperialism colonialism slavery those types of things but you know sure we want to treat those ideas in a good way in a kind of an honest way we'll talk about reason in a minute and then the hybridity is really key this is a real key postcolonial Insight from homie Baba in particular is the idea that after the encounter neither is the same so once you encounter something fundamentally different or a new culture it it bleeds into both and there is no going back and so you mix the old the new the near and the far this is to continue would I have it again this weekend I have liter in here as well is just the idea that the modernity has never existed right so um it's it's been moments of moving forward and then moving back translating even the insights of something may take you know decades or hundreds of years of a scientific insight to actually be propagated in a cultural way where we understand its significance right so um this is kind of what when we were talking about Ling and this idea of worlding this is a kind of fluid version of that now the idea of privileging of Western ideas is due to doing the Fabian socialist move for your ideas because if I say like this is a product of colonialism racism and imperialism it's going to shut some people down um particularly there's a lot of research on this I've written chapters on this uh people in positions of hierarchy and Authority don't like to recognize that their hierarchy and Authority is there right it makes them uncomfortable right talking about race is uncomfortable it's also emotionally draining so sometimes it's complicated but it would for me be a little more direct to just tell this talk about the kind of colonial appropriation of experiences from Latin America Africa the Middle East and Asia within the white Western Canon right like the British let's do the Commonwealth the British colonial experience impacts both Britain and contributes to how it thinks about things there was a kind of terrible Tom Hardy show called taboo it was fun to watch but the premise was flawed but a central premise was that what was happening at the center of Britain was also tied to the settlement problems that were happening in BC that those political the capacity to extract resources from these new areas was of political significance to the center and the the core the peripheral the core's relationship to the periphery so what the weird negation here is that like these aren't like we're still using the referent Point as the West right when we're talking about not the West which I guess is a hybrid move to talk about this kind of colonial legacies without calling it colonialism because that's too political for a kind of liberal approach um and honestly like it's a bad naming exercise I think the premise comes back to the idea that we want to have a single univocal way to frame all of the world that isn't the West so we just say non-west um but this in itself produces what we'll talk about with Saeed is a type of orientalism which is the kind of abstraction of the actual experiences of the non-western world into something that we create as a monolithic thing it's like how Canada talks about indigenous communities as if they're wondering if there's not like thousands of languages and and centuries of different experience and we just say like English experience French experience indigenous experience in Canada not even the same like the Inuit are not the same as the hot on Ashanti right like there's big differences built into this um and so for me it's like why don't we start with hybridity as the starting point like why don't we just talk about Global ideas right um think about it that are local ideas let's do glocal we take very minutiae ideas or very abstract idiots and then there's the problem of my position location so there's a couple of things bound up in this here I am going to take the back seat because I mean we have YouTube I have YouTube I'm set up to do this if rather than me tell you what to think about experts which I feel their chapter does a bit that we can just let the experts talk about themselves to themselves about their ideas we have their their ideas I've got spivex idea we'll just show us be back so we're going to do that now I'm conscious of two things here in the western tradition like I did last week in the western rational tradition ruthless criticism is the the you know the arist Aristotelian impetus right the West loves to to revolutionize through ruthless criticism and tearing down institutions and structures um so that itself is to provincialize that is a form of kind of cultural attitude um it's not always appropriate in the context especially when we're dealing with different experiences for me to ruthlessly do that um like I said there's a lot of men in this week um which itself isn't really unpacked as if there aren't ideas coming from women this whole time as well or let's be clear lots of other communities there's not a lot of indigeneity here um that's because we're kind of this is really a post-colonial chapter it's looking at the relationships of kind of colonial experience and the ways in which we have listened to or not listened to those ideas over space and time so we'll do that so I'm going to try to get out of the way but I also think my value added here and this is I think this is the point that speedvac makes where is it here in dealing with power and privilege just the idea that there is a danger too which is why I picked this textbook there's a danger to in the western Canon because it doesn't understand something to not engage with it and not take it seriously which is really I think dangerous for those in positions of power and privilege because you're saying that I'm going to replicate those positions of power privilege and not do anything with that power and privilege right um and so it's you can't unlearn Your Privilege it's historical it's it's larger than your personal Goodwill you know this this idea of being suspicious of those interested in ideas that they're not comfortable with or they don't know well your upper class well of course I've got all sorts of power and privilege but you got to use it right like that's the whole impetus here is that we've got to use that power and privilege it's not to shy away from power and privilege and not talk about things because the subject location is isn't so I'm going to take these seriously I'm going to let those voices speak for themselves I will engage where I I can but I'm not going to just ruthlessly criticize it because it doesn't fit the a western Canon as well right and so this is based on the idea of eurocentricism so it we use Euro but it's because of the Enlightenment traditions in the Renaissance Traditions that we've talked about all along is it's this idea that West is best and we need to civilize the rest this language is is everywhere all the time um and so provincializing is just you know localize it talk about how it's not a universal idea it's actually comes from a very specific history and trajectory there's nothing wrong with looking at the history of ideas it's really important to look at the history ideas um I I followed Dan McClellan on Tick Tock and he just looks like kind of ruthlessly takes the the history of the ways in which the Bible has been interpreted over time and the historical context and he focuses on the poly vocality of the Bible it's just texts say different things they contradict themselves we can talk about those and so we need to look at the history in order to understand those um I will say the West tends to privilege written texts over experience stories telling literature and narrative this isn't really addressed in the text but one of the things that Syed is looking at it's a it's a literary critical work orientalism so he's saying how is the Orient and the occident both thoroughly interpenetrated with their experiences of themselves but the ones writing the literature is largely in the western Canon and that's because it's easy for us to transmit Western ideas because we want to rip them out of context and send them back home right um Linda Twilight Smith talks about this and when she says decolonizing methodologies the university itself is a colonial construct because it seeks to go out in the world collect those ideas bring them back here to sell the US students right and so this idea of of the University being the site of Savior them I think we can see it in the reflection of the text that we have in this chapter is that it's still largely reflects structures of patriarchy um and and power and that's I mean that's me too I'm going to do those but we have to be conscious about them and we have to be critical of them like I could just as easily and I have in the past because the textbook selection we don't talk about this at all right so I think it's better to talk about it and perhaps do it poorly than not talk about it at all but I'm not going to claim authority over these these ways of thinking that doesn't make any sense for me I will highlight that sorry I've got uh Ilion Kapoor stuff so this is Elaine I've worked on a couple things with um and he's at York and he produced this book just last year talking about the idea of of the universe of politics and I think I've mentioned this before but if we're going to look at a universal politics in a kind of non-western way we have to get around the idea of it having a positive content that we can think about the idea of uh social antagonism shared experiences of exploitation and marginalization the oppressor and all of us right um and we'll come back to that again this week it's not about being Pure or having an abstract platonic ideal that we can escape the contingency of the articulation of a claim everybody is articulating a claim and those articulations have claimed then require us to think about how we perpetuate exclusion and marginalization and that exclusion of marginalization can be the universal basis of politics so I'll show a bit of his clip maybe make a couple comments on it because I I know this text better again this is just him saying that all of and this is provincial this is a provincializing move right all Universal claims are going to inherently be contingent so again this is our postcovid Zoom seminar sessions first because negative universality is and can only be taken up from a particular vantage point it is always partial partisan contingent so there's a paradox here the universe universality can only be articulated from a specific standpoint making it possible to avert the postmodern trap of insisting on particularity while denying truth in part so this is the the danger and he's talking about this is is the idea that if we only focus on where claims have come from we don't look at the claims and if we only focus on the claims we don't know where they've come from and so in the current moment we're caught in this trap we won't listen to voices if they don't reflect the community in which they come and we won't listen to the idea of those voices we'll look at who's articulating the claim and and he's arguing here that no no we have to get around this this supposed Paradox but this is definitional since any claim to the particular cannot be made without recourse to the universal as Hegel famously notes the master needs the slave as other in order to be recognized as monsters that is the very claim to master hood is unintelligible without a shared language and in the same vein Etienne points out that even a racist anti-universalism so the racist idea that whites are superior to blacks for example even that must invoke a universal Benchmark the you the notion of what it is to be human is to enable the comparison between white and black and the first place so particularity needs another and the shared language to distinguish itself as unique thus always proclaiming its particularity from a universal spam and that by the way is our main critique of all those who advocate for a localism or or a plural versality but partly the universal truth dimension of every particular stems from the antagonism at its very heart that is to say that truth is both contingent and Universal every situation may well articulate a particular truth but the emergence of that truth arises to the as a result of the antagonism that besets all situations so the real here the antagonism is thereby a contextualized antagonism so a specific human rights claim that you are violating my rights because you're kicking me out of my place because I have a pet it's it's couldn't be more contingent and Universal to the jurisdiction the laws whatever the claims that are being made but the idea of being persecuted for something that is what you love or what you do that itself is is a universal experience right that and so the idea here is that you can't do one without the other someone is always making a universal claim and I'll go with can't for example we'll talk about him we tend to read kantian Theory so Emmanuel can't we read his theory without reading his anthropology which is crazy racist and geopolitical and all the rest of it but we treat as ideas as separate from these other racist contingent claims and no we have to see them all together which is to say that those are Universal claims being made are also a contingent claim of somebody who has a whole bunch of ideas that are of his time and include race and include ways to think about how he experiences those things so we have to do both at the same time the problem is is the West has always privileged just the universal claim and never looked at its contingent articulation or if they do look at its contingent articulation to just say ignore it the ideas are what matter and what the provincial move is to say no no no you got to look at where it comes from right it can't just be Universal it's got to be contingent someone is always making a claim and someone is in the claim is always articulating ideas of the universal
