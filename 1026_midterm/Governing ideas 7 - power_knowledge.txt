 so as we've moved we've got these the power two resource capacity and mobilization power over this kind of fight between different groups that may have exclusive domain over certain ways and again those memes are not testable there's just examples we're going to deal here with Michelle Foucault and the idea of um power being related to knowledge this is why when I said I don't have that single definition of power this one in particular creates all sorts of ways in which it's really complicated to think about these these things so the philosopher social theorist you want to look beyond the state to see how power operates so interested in kind of thinking about the historical and social construction of of the ways in which we do things right um you know looking at the specific history and developing abstractions in a more contextualized way rather than these abstract approaches like the nation state we're going to think about power as it as it is connected to different Dynamics and relationships and so you know thinking about how the ways that we are able to conceptualize criticism and what conceptualized and is it possible to conceptualize criticism that the problem is is that good and bad themselves are going to reflect power and interests right so as we saw in all those memes there are different ways in which you know ageism or hierarchy are being pitted against one another or being pitted against groups as forms of good or bad and so he invokes Concepts rather than nation-state based or government government based that are very kind of Broad and contained within them all of the conceptions of power so normalcy right how is it that normalcy becomes a thing where we use a you know it goes back to kind of gaussian standard distributions so mathematicians figure out oh look things kind of emerge in these patterns so let's take those patterns and post them on society and if you're not normal you are going to throw you in these institutions and we are going to try to fix you and make you normal and everyone should be normal and then I'm not being normal enough and so normalcy becomes the thing that that I use to discipline myself oh I don't you know I don't look proper when I'm going out I don't look normal I don't look fashionable I don't do these things the ways in which those Concepts and ideas that power stems and controls and feeds back on itself and so that it is everywhere comes from everywhere we submit to it and we deploy it that my performance of normativity then results in other people understanding that normativity as that's how they should be right or not thinking about that normativity in the way in which they do things and so it becomes disciplinary and biopolitical biopower in the ways in which we in a physical way transform ourselves to conform to ideas that reflect specific interests goals and ideas um like these things right so that this is the way in which kind of normativity produces the idea that because it happens it should happen and that there's nothing wrong with it happening and that these are ways in which you know I always like humor humor is a good way to kind of show the the the ways in which the way we do things is weird right and so it's the weirdness of all of this is that critiquing Concepts is showing how all concepts are weird right why is it that we adopt them why would this be good why is this good or bad and how does good or bad change kind of radically depending on where we are in my lawn and being evil right um and so disciplinary power then is exercised on individual bodies either by the state or by different mechanisms or by ourselves over our own bodies because we try to Aspire to something that is told to us or reinforced to us as the way in which it should be um and so appropriate forms of behavior um this is social approval and reward for doing things a certain way or you know with the the new systems with you with um China and social surveillance so if you uh cross the street not at a crosswalk before you reach the other side of the street the surveillance cameras have recognized your face and deducted that money from your bank account um for the fine of you doing something wrong right that the the form of re rewarding and reinforcing behavior is so immediate that it becomes something that we internalize right so that we do it and I agree with some of them right like probably we need everybody driving one side of the road if some people start driving on other sides of the road that's a problem for everybody else right so there's ways in which this this is socially beneficial but then if you go to a different context where the driver on the other side of the road it's reversed right so it's not truth per se it's good or bad right because it doesn't hold over all places and times it's societal contextualized right and so these are all forms of social inclusion and exclusion how these changes over time how some persons allowed to be the way they are and then they're not we think about these things um look up the subreddit Sapphire friend right the ways in which we just like blind ourselves through consensus to the ways things are when there's all sorts of stuff happening all the time all around us that isn't the way that we think it is right um and so we have all of these ideas about bodies and what they're supposed to do and where they emerge I mean the the key part about the lgbtq 2s is the two-spirit predates all the Western modern constructions of even gender there's a great book a great article by the lones that says the gender itself is a colonial construct that you wouldn't have the very concept of gender without a colonial construct so two-spirit I don't need to get into too much we'll deal with it later in the course but you know the two spirit the idea that people can move Express themselves differently um in terms of kind of masculine and feminine characteristics at different points in time predates all the rest of this stuff predates the very concept of deviant or mentally ill and so the idea that we would use deviant or mentally ill to impose it on those structures is odd it's a reflection of power and interest it's not truth right um not only that the weirdest part of all this stuff is that back to the authoritarianism like people get enjoyment perverse enjoyment out of Regulation and being regulated and like enforcing like karening right like karening is the best example of using social structures to him enforce like use police on other bodies I'm calling cops at you because you've looked through my window or whatever right that you can use social structures of power in order to do those things even though well I don't know if we want to let Karen's out white women elected Trump so I mean you do what you want with that I don't know what that means for intersectionality but the idea here is that um regulation itself becomes something that people are invested in so both in terms of following and then also from the gratification they get for doing it um what does this mean it just means that discipline doesn't mean one thing and that legitimately if power is everywhere and comes from everywhere like the signs that you put up about how your mom's chug wine reinforce forms of normativity right the oppressors in all of us and so this means then that what we do and how we do is bound up with the state and what the state authorizes as legitimate Behavior and the lives that it saves right putting defibrillators in ice hockey Arenas means that if you're doing the Canadian sport of ice hockey and do you have a heart attack again because those guys you know Weekend Warriors do all the rest of it um they they do that so those lives will save be saved versus another sport I don't know I mean curling and ice hockey are often together but other sports where those defibrillators don't exist that's an expression of state power over life and death and so that we have a tradition now it's it's a popular tradition really came out after 9 11 because of the idea of the state having this license to surveil to track to live to die to extraordinarily rendition to put you in Guantanamo Bay where the state has literal control over your life and death all aspects Force feeding right that doesn't matter what you do you can do that um and so this comes back to the idea of simple Concepts like this that we have zombies as biopolitical as the idea that how we deal with power and state power and authority is bound up in the very concept of life itself between the the living and the dead and we have these questions all the time when we talk about um uh made medically assisted um uh forms of death right that these become should the state have interest or not how we should involve this all forms of kind of social reproduction of social death biopolitical decisions on these things in in the states um all of the questions about Reproductive Rights and access to them and and non-access to them are all bound up in like who is living and dying is bound up in the power of the state and so that means that our our lives are embedded with state power they are biopolitical and so the state exerts Power by regulating managing its populations statistics on birth rates death rates instance disease accents Norwegian states have all of these campaigns and all these resources for for people to reproduce right so they're like run ads saying like go go travel with a partner and you know reproduce like the state's literally in this 90 Day Fiance 98 fiance is a great example of the idea that the state has designated 90 days whereby you two have to fall in love in a legitimate way if you want citizenship or access to our resources right States like weird decision 90 days that's the proper love length states are regulating love so this is not new this always and always everywhere will exists societies regulate this we regulate this by you know Norms about when people should reproduce or should they oh you haven't reproduced yet blah blah blah those types of things are always happen um and so when we think about those these are all of these kind of decisions about these we have words for these like necro politics right the ability to decide on who lives and dies and that's linked back to zombie culture the idea of this state or social regulation is producing healthier more productive citizens selectively applied right you know the the textbook just says the underfunding of indigenous communities I would go a bit further than just underfunding um you know the fact that you had to give up your status rights to vote until the 70s and 80s the last residential school I think closed in 96 right like these are not long times ago and then we're talking about things like just the the acronyms we have to deal with the idea that missing inverted indigenous peoples um that you know originated from this this issue that is built into our society so it's more than underfunding and so let's not express our biases so explicitly and that we have to distinguish between missing and murder indigenous women um as a persistent problem listen you know the U.N has to keep telling us to stop sterilizing in indigenous women in Canada this is a real thing that happens um that we have women and girls because we have to understand that they're targeted differently that we have two-spirit communities having to express themselves through these Frameworks that the relatives and the families relatives of residential schools are are going to be this problem and they're we're dealing with things we had the 60s scoop where kids were scooped up and sent to residential schools but now we're talking about the millennial school but this isn't just like a critical approach this is the government's own website that I pulled this from uh if you look at right now this is the latest statistic this was in 2021 this is what the that's the link the government of Canada gc.ca has this on their own website saying the indigenous um uh children in Canada represent 7.7 percent of the total population of children 0 to 14 in Canada and they're 54 of children in foster care and so we're working towards reconciliation and we're working towards these issues but just saying underfunding indigenous communities seems to understate what we're talking about when we're talking about biopower because we all agree that residential schools were awful but this system is still in place which is 54 of children not being with their families in a system that the states have created and instituted so the textbook I don't know I think a lot of people have Pandemic fatigue at this point um but the textbook trying to be up to date um tries to talk about the pandemic the idea of you know forms of power Sovereign disciplinarian biopower evident in the pandemic everything from closing borders to vaccine mandates to social distancing to mask wearing I don't really want to talk about those things anymore I think we've talked to them today see that's one of the interesting things about politics right these were so such contentious political issues but everyone because we are iterative creatures like we learn through repetition because we learned through repetition if something gets repeated too much we can't learn anything new from it so I think we've heard a lot of the same thing over and over again this may be useful to like for the generation after you how would you describe the pandemic it would be useful for you and they will sound to you like I say if I would like what where were you when 9 11 happened you weren't born right it's the same thing those things just turn into the history of the past and then the ability of that majority group to impose that as something you need to learn about onto everybody else is a reflection of power and interest so the biopower is public health monitoring of infection rates testing and contract tracing exercising the three forms of power meet with resistance counter discourses acts of rebellion dissonance ways in which this anti-mass approach has spread of misinformation online misinformation as always will always happen or the extent is the scale and scope online right whether it's more or less I don't know yellow journalism's always been around and so the impact of covid on Modern Politics on Supply chains on inflation on housing prices rent everything so we can't go back but we also don't know about the future and there isn't really a way I mean I have a chapter written about this we knew full well that that states were going to manipulate these systems when the next pandemic happened but because we all believed I guess in perfect information we thought the people weren't going to be ignorant right we we knew we knew that um people had been advocating anti-back stuff well before the pandemic and will continue to and always have but the lack of preparation raises more fundamental questions about how we think about ignorance that's why I'm big on ignorance right thinking thinking about a politically think about ignorance ignorance is not the absence of information it is having certain information over others which we will all do we're all ignorant to things you have to be your brain doesn't I don't even know if you could make sense if you had access to all the information of the world we are difference engines we decide what we need to value and what we don't value when we prioritize those things and so ignorance is not the absence of information and the weird part is I can say that a hundred times and I have students in class will tell me that ignorance is the absence of information or that learning is the solution to problems I mean how much more information anyways I'm not going to get into them um Okay so um I will add on probably an additional video after this that summarizes the video we'll see um but the idea here is that this week asked questions um how do we organize things that are in common uh who do we make decisions for and how are they made and then how do we reflect or obligate those decisions they're contested so they like the idea of contestation I do think there is some space for cooperation Harmony and consultation but the West Lakes contest which to me is a bit aggressive um and the critical today as they were in in Aristotle size but critical we need to be critical about what Aristotle's time was and the way it's being deployed today as well and so that's why they're critical Concepts we have to be critical of the concepts and see which ones we think are important but not claim that one is so important at the expense of all the others
