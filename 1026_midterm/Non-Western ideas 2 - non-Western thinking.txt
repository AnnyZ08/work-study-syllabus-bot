 so um I'm gonna split this up one and last the last lecture was really long and there was a lot of ideas in it so I'm going to try to to be a bit more concise and let the text do the the talking for me the videos do the talking for me um so I'll break these up and most of them will have one clip with each things that I can comment on or not it depends so um all of this problem of voices that we've been talking about really every week is persisting here it comes to the four here right and so these are the different arguments that have been articulated um over and over again a lot of this stuff that I bring in that's my extra stuff um this week comes from the yes we can reading um it was just about all of these questions that are being posed so these are people who are experiencing the Western Canon and saying these questions that come from that um and so the idea here is is that you get caught in that trap if you make the claim that is legible to a western audience you don't sound non-western um and if you make a claim that is not legible to the Western audience then it's non-western and so it can never kind of be both right at the same time and so this idea of you know devaluing certain people by dismissing well not even intentionally by highlighting European philosophy produces this kind of this enacting of what are legitimate actors even the idea of non-western is already kind of gross right it's kind of saying that well it's not Western so we'll just lump it into this category of something else and so if racism is a classification system it's an epistemic mover it's not real it's just something we do um that we we impose on things that are scientific in order to say they're valid or not and so you know it's just this way that we can do thinking differently and so so a lot of this in particular because he was a very influential scholar is Saeed is is what he does in orientalism which I think we produce in 78. um was this idea that there are stereotypes about the Orient the non-west that are produced in the oxidant which is the west and that the two of them are mutually co-constituted that you can't think about what it means to be Western without thinking about its distinguishment from the non-western world and so these stereotypes then are reproduced over and over and over again particularly if we're talking about Middle Eastern stereotypes the islamophobia that's been inherent in it for as long as the West has kind of thought about itself as distinct is kind of built into that Syed in particular takes on Huntington's Clash of civilizations as being um just the the kind of the the most popular form of this Oriental thinking that just takes over how we think about conflict in the world and it becomes a a darling of foreign policy and all the rest of it and so this idea of of portraying everybody who's not Western as a rational or violence or inferior despotic or passive is why I keep saying that liberalism has no endogenous theory of violence right in the tradition of the West which has been incredibly violent and we we justify those violence all the time in terms of uh you know the the structures and institutions in 1648 and the peace and all the rest of it as necessary but at the same time has no theory of it because it always says it's it's liberalism claims it's the it's all of these other categories that are producing the violence right and so the oxidant is constantly defining itself well we're not violent they're violent right even while it engages in violence in order to get rid of that violence in the world right so this this idea we'll come to it later but Democratic peace theory that democracies don't go to war with each other not only is it not factually true democracies go to war all the time with non-democracies and always blame the non-demore no listen some of it's Justified some of this no but but it's the idea that violence is always on the outside it's never it's never internal right so here's a bit of um Sayyid just talking about orientalism so what does orientalism say oh is this Syed it might not be said this might be another video maybe saeed's book orientalism is a critique okay so now this is just repeating what I said I thought I had a clip of saying I can find a clip of Satan stick him in later actually I'll just put it in the playlist of modern European colonialism the book argues that colonialism was not only a system of political rule but also was an all-around world view that simply believed the West Was superior to the east Saeed examined scholarly debates about near Eastern cultures especially those that were mainly Muslim he then challenged common Western assumptions about these colonized societies because he was looking at academic debates saeed's work in orientalism was designed to show that the academic world was closely connected to the system of political power Saeed was seeking to prove that academics had in effect collaborate in the west domination so that's the key premise of having this chapter called non-western look at all the power we have in deciding which ideas count which ones are considered and which ones aren't of the East Saeed argued that European colonialism was really about taking advantage of colonized people's labor and their resources while at the same time claiming that the Western colonial power was a savior helping these societies to become more modern like Europe this was easier for the colonial power to do because it consistently categorized the Orient through the use of degrading stereotypes this was saeed's main argument Saeed wrote that this colonialist thinking did not go away when colonial rule ended in the early 20th century but that it continued in different forms now this was made easier when the United States emerged as a huge Global power and according to Saeed showed a clearly orientalist's view of the world Saeed wanted academics and Society to admit that racist colonialist ideas had been supported by Western academic thinking and that the one depended on the other his ideas were controversial for sure but there is no doubt that these ideas have helped to change the way colonialism is understood now so why does orientalism matter orientalism is a very important book that has had a wide influence both in the university and in politics it is a key text in post-colonial studies and was considered revolutionary when it first appeared in 1978. Syed showed how academic writing can be deeply connected to the politics and workings of colonialism and how the one fed the other in order to justify the West's self-imposed status as a superior culture according to Saeed colonialism wasn't just the act of colonizing a particular place it was an all-encompassing way of understanding the world all right so that's enough of that um oil do then is um in the next video I'll just bring in one of Saeed talking for himself that was just a summary but it that's a good clear coherent summary
