 okay and now we're at populism um again the textbook says a slippery concept less a particular ideology and more a strategy to gain power I again no no surprise I disagree uh this is a weird history to a weird refusal to read the history of sophism uh rhetoric and Charisma which have been around that this was one of the things that Plato tried to challenge right tied to both left and right I mean you can if I have a bucket everything that goes in it's going to fit in the bucket right like because it's a bucket I mean you just keep using it over and over again without thinking about it like there's that's the lack of critical Concepts that's the opposite that's the imposition of a concept anyways um arises all the time citizens are frustrated sure okay all those examples people versus Elite um occupy brexit Donald Trump during the swamp we actually want to do that there's a interesting I have a lecture in my other class where we talk about um the idea of the deep space deep State this is a long been established I mean Pierre Trudeau was against the idea that there was a bureaucracy especially in the foreign policy apparatus in Canada that he couldn't change right so it's not you know we don't have to do them be beholden to the prisoner of the moment to think about these ideas rather than just react to them so sophism um you know this was in the 5th Century BC it was the art of rhetoric and persuasion rhetorical argumentation was a skill that was taught um as something that that could could provide you with the ability to capture the minds of people to be charismatic um it was extreme moral relativism that relied on some objective claims in Charisma it didn't have to worry about the facts so Plato explicitly viewed gagorus as a skillful order who wasn't actually interested in debating and he didn't want to debate them because he was not there's no need for debate if you're a skillful order you're telling a tale you're providing a monovocal narrative that allows you to frame things in a specific way kind of like this chapter um the other part about the um the sophists was that um they were seen as crass by Plato and the others because they weren't reasoning their arguments they were being persuasive and being rhetorical um and they were teaching that to others to be persuasive in mature rhetorical to make money so it was the crass money making of money by selling their skills as Educators which uh okay um I'll move a lot um so you know uh Plato challenges Gregor's credibility I have the link to this is actually on this image if you click it um judging by his character alone he hates to be proven wrong and never forfeits a debate until he wins so it's about winning more than anything else um the order can't be blamed for his insistence on winning it's what he teaches and then how he teaches and so you just it's win it's it's own the libs it's uh you know mic drop it's whatever you want that that proves that you're right because of the strength of your your the strength and skill of what you're saying not the content of what you're saying right um it stands in contrast to Socrates who tells him you'd love nothing more to than to be proven wrong um and then bring him to his ultimate objective the truth and so you know he calls or gregoris calls uh Socrates incessant questioning of society's most basically accepted Concepts childlike and disruptive the order doesn't see interest in abstract that's not Community truth and logic don't sway elections they're destroyed invading armies we need nationalism mobilization Charisma leadership um all of these things to do that so Socrates wants to to do this idea of examining life rather than swaying political outcomes and so there's this fundamental tension there about populism about the ways in which people are swayed over and over again not based on reason but based on Charisma and Leadership and the arguments you make and so this is recurrent and this is what what Hailey lupus because this this dog whistle politics it's speaking in code to a target audience it's in group out group stuff you can build an in-group and you all agree that this is the thing that we believe in and because we believe in it we're going to act in a coherent fashion do this in any group civil rights protesters members of religious right environmental gun rights politics it's shocking to me that a chapter on on the idea of radical ideas doesn't understand populism rhetoric Charisma or leadership I fundamentally don't get how they're not I guess because they're subset Dynamics and they don't fall into an ism like it's it's your categories leading your analysis not your analysis leaving the categories right so basic moves of dog whistle you know you thinly veiled reference to there's a threat out there that that it's being posed to us this isn't us being prejudiced against that issue um it's the critic who's being opportunistic so this is gotcha journalism right like if you try to prove me wrong that's just gotcha journalism like you you're the problem by playing gotcha journalism not me who's made the mistake it's rhetorical moves series of rhetorical moves um so I personally experienced this in the Ontario provincial complaint in 2007 um where I was getting called because I was in the writing downtown um where John Tory of all people now disgraced Mayor John Tory um of Toronto was running as the conservative uh and what he dared to do was to do what the UN has persistently chastised Ontario for doing which is funding of one religious school over others and so what Tori said is I want to equally fund religious schools assuming that he would cater to all the different religious communities however that was perceived as an attack on the Catholic school system in Ontario which allows Public Funding to go to one religious organization which then can only hire people of that Faith to work in their institution and as a consequence of that um I got phone calls claiming that John Tory wants to support Muslim schools in Ontario I'm like oh okay this is what we're doing it was just a liberal deployment of the idea of the threat of of of uh faith-based schools which we have against the idea of what he was doing which was equality and so this gets deployed all the time by all different actors in all different I mean the states rights against integration how does the federal government have the right to do this had the federal government doesn't have any right to tell Alberta what to do like all different ways we can do this and which you don't even actually just say what it is that you actually want you just implicate it through this dog whistle so people read what it is and so this comes from um and populism and racism go hand in hand because they are appealing to an in-group against a group or appealing to an in-group with a secret coded message about the out group right um so George Wallace was famous for in his first move um he was a relatively moderate racist in the U.S he was civil and he was perceived as being too soft on race relations so he just reinvented himself as a racial reactionary uh utilizing the n-word as mobilizing um you know defending the clan defending segregation personally stood to block black students from getting into class he ended up with 95 support so it's populist to appeal to an in-group against it out group and as a populist to utilize racist in a racist system in order to get votes and so they discovered specifically the use of non-racial language or or things like states rights as a justification for forms of uh continued marginalization and oppression um so you know beating Nixon in the primaries um and Nixon uh came up with his idea of Law and Order and so you know mass incarceration begins because it's a rhetorical move in order to make people think that you're doing what they want and so populism speaks to specific groups using anti-elite language and produce Perse the idea of my culture there's lots of this kind of working class sensibility you know pickup trucks rolling coal uh fishing poles cheap beer NASCAR all sorts of humor that's for in groups and out groups it becomes in the South this is a specific strategy even Democrats use in the South um use the language of dog whistles use the idea of middle class versus welfare versus taxes versus illegencia versus elitism it doesn't have to make any sense it's rhetoric it doesn't have to make any sense most southern states receive more in federal funding than they give out and pay in taxes and contribute and most of that goes to poor whites and the strategy that works on them is for them to be racist against the other poor people in their exact same neighborhoods and communities right I mean it's what it is and so it's not just American Canada has a history of this you know Rob Ford was a precursor to Trump he was both racist while being Multicultural from Etobicoke he would do all these accents and stuff I mean you can look it up you smoke crack I mean you can look it up there's pictures of it um and but that that didn't hurt him like smoking crack didn't hurt him because it was proceeded as working class solidarity it was early Trump like at one point I heard on 640 news um somebody called in and said they wouldn't care if he murdered someone as long as they lowered taxes famously that happened during Trump's campaign uh where someone said you know he said I I could walk out on the street as long as I lowered taxes I could murder someone in Manhattan it's this idea of populism overriding reason with rhetoric right it's a form of identification with charismatic leaders and so it's seen as an attack on the liberal system which it kind of is but it's still Democratic and popular the problem is it's not liberal Democratic and so it becomes with illiberal things and so we see this and we see this I would say in general with what we call overly partisan framings which I don't know that we've never not been partisan and never been in group out group but what the argument here is that we don't actually need to debate ideas anymore because there's no debate taking place because we're appealing to or in groups and out groups and so we saw this happen in Ontario where you know a poor students are calling anti-democratic or smart political strategy absolutely smart political strategy that came up with thousands of years ago it's not even interesting it's it's this and so this is in the 2024 debates there is an argument that Trump just uses rhetoric he doesn't use facts and he appeals to emotion and he as a consequence you can't logically debate him and so there shouldn't be a logical debate and so this is the problem of that now you just get to pick your Monarch I guess each side gets a monarch it's it's a weird situation um I'll just do this as well because because we're here um and so what this means then you know covid demonstrated all of these things coming together the rule of state power the rule of political parties the role of uh leadership the role of the ways in which um impacts are felt differentially and impacts are are chosen differentially the way that we view government the government's role in intervention the government as overstepping or understepping the inability to stop things or allow other things to happen uh intersections of race poverty gender and geography yes absolutely especially in Canada it's always been the case will always be the case and so this social determinants of Health has much to do with where you are as who you are right you can you know marketers can predict more by your postal code than by anything else in the U.S they know where you live that tells them almost everything about who you are right terms of marketing and advertising and politics um and so the idea revealed the dangers of fake news and anti-spire science conspiracies kind of um Ontario famously did a pro-vaccination campaign where if you didn't want your kids to be vaccinated you had to go to education it had a zero percent conversion rate so the schools in charge of Education were able to convince no one through their education of the parents that they should vaccinate their kids if they didn't want to this has nothing to do with covet it has to do with anti-vac stuff has been around forever and for certain communities for example of the Tuskegee experiments we know that in the past look up what the CIA did and when it was trying to track down how it did track down Osama Bin Laden um they thought it would be a good idea to run fake vaccination campaigns which then resulted in people not trusting vaccination campaigns any further in the region around Pakistan where the karosan bin Laden why'd they do that National Security um so the idea that the cleavages that that unite the world or the collaborations that the world Technologies invite the world the the the Immigrant populations that were the scientists who came up with the covid vaccines and the ways in which all of these things are together but the ways in which we can utilize anything to create new divisions uh I mean I you know I don't want to have these debates um science is Practice Science isn't necessarily truth um it's it's you know that I always use the example um uh um colonoscopies uh for men over 50 right something about these things um so they for the longest time over 50 you're supposed to literally have your junk inspected something put in you in order to make sure that you didn't have this and then they did The Meta studies at epidemiological study where they looked at everything and said wait the interventions to prevent colon cancer are actually resulting in lower um life expectancy than if they had just left the cancer untreated so one day science said I have to get something up my butt next day they said you didn't science is practice it's it's learning it's it's not going to be perfect truth the danger is people who treat science as a universal truth and don't think about it in context in open systems and that's the problem of you know this is what my chapter on kovitz about is about the idea that that early on especially liberals treated all Sciences absolute truth when it was contextual truth that needed to be understood as experimentation and the best that we have at the moment right not Universal truths and as a consequence of that then and the changing of opinions based on new evidence was seen as well you told me one thing and now you told me another and then that drove in group and out group identifications um so I mean but there's a lot of reasons to do this there's logares there's a reason that indigenous communities were targeted first for the Cove vaccine because they don't have infrastructure they don't have access to health care they don't do those those resources um they they don't have those resources and traditionally they have been the last to get this stuff and they have been experimented on and we have done all those things so there is well-founded reasons for uh minority populations to be suspicious of campaigns medical campaigns against them that doesn't mean they shouldn't get access and I think it was interesting that Canada put them to the throne of the line because if they did happen on the reserves they don't have the healthcare infrastructure there it's kind of double recognition of the failures of the modern nation state to deal with this so anyways I'm sure I've said something that was stupid uh on covid that you objected to but but that's kind of what we're dealing with here is that radical ideas exist right there's a form of social critique about the root problems of societies ideologies can be understand as having and as rational or negative Concepts again reason is based on the liberal precept that we can reasonably debate ideas not that you're going to be convinced by the the sway of ideas ideologies articulate different political goals radical ideologies include socialism communism fat yeah whatever and new challenges leads to new ideas that put old ideas will still remain I do agree with that um I'll stop there this is in case I get a copyright strike this is just a video that I'll include in the next
