 so just to follow up here um I mentioned in the last video not taking adversarial relationship that's a key issue when we're dealing with modern liberal thought that we'll get to in a second because the idea a lot of our politics like I mean Western binaries reinforce the idea let's look at the legal system and adversarial relationship is a key Dynamic to the the development and progress of a legal system why because we have two sides fighting um to to to win and it produces the best outcome right uh in politics we have adversarial politics between parties um because we believe that the rational and reasonable argument for ideas makes the best arguments come to the top the reason that the honor and duty of the crown is so important here is that you cannot and so I see this all the time when politicians are political uh thought exercises take an adversarial relationship with indigenous communities in Canada you can't do that um you can do that if you don't like your Constitution and you want to create a new one but you set up this system in structures you cannot do that so every time I see a politician or somebody or even those thought exercises that that take adversarial positions with relationship to indigenous peoples in Canada okay fine get rid of your get rid of your Constitution there get rid of the get rid of the 1763 Royal Proclamation which is 1982 Bill of Rights you've got to restart the whole thing have fun with that rewrite your Constitution it's not sorry it's not our church the queen said it you've repeated it it's there over and over again you cannot take adversary relationship ever since relationships with indigenous communities in Canada because the Crown's honor and duty is honor is at stake so if you're going to do that you got to get rid of the crown sorry not my rules your rules so the idea here is that when we're dealing with the the Contemporary thinkers they are trying to justify the systems we have through reason and argument and logic and philosophy um on their own merits so it takes the the idea of Reason over religious authority to The Logical extreme um that that the idea of reason then should be the only system by which um politics is based and so this is what a classic liberal believes that we should have an honest discussion debate of ideas the best ideas come to the surface and those best ideas should be how we govern Society it's waifukuyama believes we're at the end of history there can be no more reasonable logical debates now he has a later book where he said that genetic modification can result in superhumans who then would restart history because their terms of discussion and debate would no longer be ours they would be fundamentally distinct from humans so again we're bound up in the idea of what a human is and how they do this so what this means for contemporary liberal thinkers we need a purely reasonable justification for the liberal system uh we can't look at power and authority as existing outside of ideas ideas are the only way that we have this order and so we we shift the focus from freedom and equality or resistance to traditional forms of authority that we have in in the emergence of these this kind of reimagining of the Greek city-state into one that that tries to frame things as the only good is is what we agree on and we all agree that the best idea we can come up with is respect of Tolerance that tolerance again this is totally reasonable because if you have to tolerate anybody you know sure as heck that you don't actually like them you're just tolerating them um is that there's an emotional underpinning there and that emotional underpinning It's the Return of the Year repressed it's the idea that when you push something down inside it always comes back in other ways um and so these are roles John Rawls this this classic liberal thinker comes up with this idea is that we can never agree that we should worship one particular kind of God or that we should worship at all we can never agree that we should hold certain values when we're raising our children we can never agree that we should mate in these and not other ways and we never agree that we should the only should we can agree on is to be taller in a variety of ways to which to worship to instill values to make families structures of kinship and so on so it's it's creating kind of a minimal threshold model it's kind of like the the best of the worst what's the bare minimum that a liberal Society has to have as the foundation in order to be Democratic well it has to do this it should should should doesn't mean we will so so like fukuyam it doesn't mean that we're all going to be liberal Democrats it means that the best we can aspire to is this um I do think it is weird to talk about raising children and mating in the abstract and mating itself like what if we don't want to meet what if we just want relationship anyways um what I'm saying here is there's a lack of gender in in the framing of this there's lack of uh intersectionality lack of various lack of settlement to all the rest of that so the idea here is that there's a debate between these different um people so you know Rawls is doing this kind of minimal idea that we should tolerate or respect our differences um whereas Charlie Charles Taylor and McIntyre they say no no it has to be more than that we have to do more the city the Greek city states now you have to actively engage right it's not enough to have everybody barely tolerate each other we have to actually you know to to have civic virtue is to you know engage in political process to vote to have public dialogue to make your ideas heard to exchange ideas and then decide which ideas we we come to some types of agreements on and so political life is more than just the institutions and the representative structures we create um you know much of what we do is that we don't do it alienation so our inability to deal with with those structures is is as much how we think about politics as anything else it animates social movements it animates Civic associations it animates that you know somebody wants to show off their Gardens so they have a garden tour somebody wants to show off I don't know their Farms so they have a farm tour somebody wants to show off their Arts they have an art tour like those things all require forms of uh mobilization resources ideas and they change the public order and they often say that we this then justifies public funds which we we share in common that we tax and then redistribute right and so these differences then are are cultural differences and here culture is doing a lot of work um because there isn't a theory of contestation per se here there's just a theory of reasons differences right and so we can reasonably differ on what we we argue is the best way to organize systems now the textbook deals of this and we'll do this as well this this political again totally sees the economic as secondary and outside and doesn't have a clear your theory endogenously of how hierarchies exist whereby some people get massive amounts of power and control and others don't because they're not doing that work they're trying to think of what's the most reasonable way to organize their society that's the sympathetic reading the the that we should be doing this is what we should Aspire towards and we're coming up with the shoulds for everybody the practicalities are always going to be a contested you know on the ground explanation this is an analytical Theory right and so there are of course radical critiques I'll just go right into them um the idea of course is that Marxism emerges from Marx's experiences of industrial capitalism in Britain when it emerges right this transition from feudalism capitalism he's trying to think these things and so real power is not the political institutions at all it's back to those hierarchical structures as I showed with that video I wasn't intending to be intentionally Marxist or anything just showing that hierarchical structures of feudalism the higher hierarchical structures of capitalism look very similar right and to him until you get rid of all those structures on the top that we don't have communism right we want to get rid of all those structures on the top and so the idea here is that the emergence of capitalism actually produces and maintains and creates greater inequality now I I'm not a Marxist I'll just put that out there I understand the value of economic thinking I don't like economic reductionism but I do understand the arguments here that that there is economic inequality perpetuated by capitalism and that you know the market imperatives clearly have have permeated many aspects of society um so you know the idea of voting with your dollars now we're contesting like what goods are bought and is that I don't know I don't even know if I want to have this to be are Goods woke or not it's it's so dumb I don't even want to have it but the idea here is that we've now we've now taken you know consumer practical kind of watch things I I buy as deeply political questions right as as at somehow the market expresses politics rather than some type of higher aspirational ideal like the the liberal theorists we want a better Society no I just want better Goods right or Worse Goods I don't know what we're doing here um and so all of these problems create perverse incentives um you know the argument has been that you know social media platforms putting out misinformation um is not that they're being immoral they're being amoral because they're pursuing Market goals so Facebook is looking to maximize its advertising Revenue if Russia is willing to pay it to advertise myths or disinformation so be it right um the problem of course is that social media systems in open systems are open you get ideas whatever you want the Flat Earth I should wear my hat upside down my shoe should go on my head whatever you want in an open system whereas in a closed system of Russia or China and this goes back to the debate from the last lecture about which system is better closed systems just say no we're never going to discuss Tiananmen we're never going to have discussions about Putin's rule we're not going to challenge these systems of authority and so you have these closed systems interacting with an open system with active goals to sabotage it I heard a discussion the other day that Putin's most likely way to resolve the conflict in Ukraine is to make sure that the person who gets elected in the U.S is sympathetic to his goals right like that's an easier way to achieve a a strictly military goal through the open system from a closed system and so if we want to talk about class conflict there's lots of ways in which we can still do that I just don't know if it's the same as producing like this is a correlated outcome so for example I saw this I heard this in podcasts the other day um almost all like investment venture capitalist money that exists are largely coming from the graduates of two schools in the U.S Stanford and Harvard that they're the ones who are most associated with it which is to say as we know but you might not know but Americans tend to identify where they went to school where Canadians tend to identify what they took in school why because this is where our system despite all of its problems still tends to be oriented towards getting the degree in the area in order to get your job whereas in these cases these are social sorting mechanisms um you know Harvard only lets in three three percent or four percent of applicants so it sees itself as social sorting and then if you manage to get one of those degrees firms can can hire you because they know that you've got access to resources networking social status and hierarchy more so than whatever it is you studied right and we can see the ways in which this is reproduced and so this produces all sorts of problems this is my this is from Thomas picketty's book on inequality it came out in 2015 2016 I guess and what he was looking at here is that if you want to talk about inequality we can talk about inequality this is both a good and bad kind of justification for the Mars position first off capitalism has absolutely reduced inequality if we look at China and the real income growth from 1978 to 2015 for the full population it's it's went up 811 percent so this is the big biggest single reduction in poverty and human history and I'm not going to take that away from capitalism it is weird that a communist system imposed capitalism but we won't talk about that right now what we're talking about is inequality and so the reduction of that inequality is great I don't think it's great for people to be better off I don't think they have the capacity to engage in society now part of this is a sleight of hand because it's much easier to move people from a peasant to a kind of lower middle class income than it is to move everybody from a middle class income to you know a high income bracket there's a lot more resources required and we've seen this and we go into the stats I'm not going to do it here but um just this shift is as meant like basic things like meat production is just skyrocketed the uh you know the demand for all consumer goods is skyrocketed because of this and so this is a huge extraction of resources but there's been General General better better off status now the problem of course is what during this same period happens elsewhere so picketty uses France because he's in France we don't need to worry so much about that the U.S is is the interesting mechanism here so during this period the US saw a 60 growth as well the problem is is that it was in no way distributed equitably so for the bottom half of the U.S population from 1978 to 2015 they saw no real uh income growth which is say at that whole 50 of the US population during that entire period saw nothing get better for them or their children so you could understand why when looking at those systems and let's be clear China's Ascension the WTO allowed U.S companies to shift production to China to sell Goods back to Americans um that this system has benefited the top a lot and the bottom objectively not at all right so the middle 40 42 that's not bad it's not the middle 40 of China which is 780 um and the top 10 I mean in U.S they had in China they had a lot of way to go the US um you know it it's it's um only 115 but if you look at the top point zero zero zero one percent those are the billionaires and they've seen a growth of 685 in Democratic systems you would think you could pass laws to make things Equitable hence the Democracy right everybody gets a vote everybody gets to say and so what we've seen though is that for that bottom 50 percent not only are the structures of democracy not resulting in them getting the same benefits as the rest of society versus other countries they're seeing a relative decline and so that then means that this mechanism is taking place if the Democratic structures aren't working the private structures are influencing the Democratic structure such that the laws and rules are not equitably benefiting everyone we're requiring rationally everyone to participate in the system you know you have to vote Vote or Die blah blah but a bottom 50 isn't seeing democracy provide outcomes for them right just just not those other systems see capitalism providing outcomes even an authoritarian system the French are seem kind of Equitable because it's friends um and so the Marxist critiques then are that there is private ownership of the means of production there's private creation of wealth but that we're not using public structures to make sure everybody benefits equally or that to make sure that the public good is best served and this public good could be yes we all agree that you know we voted for the party that we wanted the problem is in terms of these kind of material relations those people participating at fully maybe with good faith participating in the system saying I like this system because I'm going to do better in it them and their kids are objectively not doing better and so this right space model for private property has ensured that that we have this you know prioritization of Rights where the you know the right to life versus the right to housing can be inverted and so much so where we have anti-homelessness or anti the unhoused structures to deal with homelessness we designing park benches now so people can't do them we don't have access to to public spaces or public washrooms in the same way this is a real problem during covid right um and that you know we should be able to do things the democratic system should be able to pass laws to ban Bank fees and yet this this fiction that somehow the system is the private property shouldn't be impeded by democracy is undermined by the idea of the central bank is undermined by the crypto Bros because the crypto Bros said no no we don't even need this in society we're going to create our own currency but how'd that go for everybody and so this idea of Regulation right should we regulate or should we allow Ponzi schemes to pop up and everybody to lose their their Savings in a crypto scheme is two different Notions about the relationship of government and private property and Regulation and so the arguments here that Marxist critiques in the textbook are that you know workplace rules savings interest rates corporate decision making educational advancement social reproduction of home and and social reproduction of care are largely outside Democratic processes and so if they're outside Democratic processes they're being determined by market forces and we don't have any say over them because of all of these assumptions we've made about liberalism right and so the idea here is that this these radical democracy theorists again I'm not entirely clear who we're talking about um because we actually don't have any references here and with no references I think that's a straw man a straw man is something we build up in order to knock down right that's what we mean when we say strawman so astronomy on arguments are ones where no one's actually making that claim we are saying someone's making that claim in order to then say well this is why it's not real and so um class so the radical critiques here that class is not only a source of inequality I think we've Fallen back into the liberal trap of pitting uh marginalized groups against one another because they're not political we're pitting the 260 000 against each other rather than talk about why the 40 000 have full access to resources and so again I don't know who this is but the idea here is that the radical Democratic critiques are saying that Marxism and I agree with to some extent class isn't the only source of inequality um or conflict right we could frame it in those terms um and so there's disparities in economic and political power amongst men and women white non-white indigenous peoples Global North and South I I don't want to engage in these discussions we can engage in these discussions I I feel like they're disingenuous because I don't know who's making them and I do know that they're directed at the group that traditionally don't have access to power and authority so I I should be suspicious I think we should all be suspicious if you're not willing to label things and so we think this is easy enough to do to talk about inequality this is the common one that they talk about in the U.S is is the idea about how we we should structured Democratic participation so let's just do voting we just do voting voting alone doesn't tell us anything because if you have everybody vote in specific ways if we frame things as fair and we'll come back to what we mean by fair that everybody who gets to vote if it's 60 orange and 40 purple through these 50 people we would have three uh orange and two purple or three orange and two purple we could try to get them proportionate to the electorate what we see then with a lot of of Democratic structures is they're not doing that we get five orange or two orange and three purple we can we can change the way in which those are counted in order to produce different outcomes the problem with this Assumption of the radical democracy is that it can't actually make those claims because there are lots of weird problems that exist that voting alone can't resolve right so the fear in the US is party because the U.S has a binary oversimplification in Canada we have multiple political parties so we don't think about parties as left or right per se there's a whole bunch of different parties across the Spectrum it's relatively easy to get in and have discussions and debates if we still do political debates because increasingly leaders don't want to debate because they say just pick me or not right um and so the problem of course is that when we talk about voting we can see like the average age of a member of Congress for both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S is pushing 60. you're talking about having 80 year olds as presidents of the U.S that then means that there's a tacit system or structure that is not representing the age of the population of the country so we'd like to think about inequality and radical democracy in terms of well these people don't get their vote no even if they vote the representatives they're voting for don't reflect them so we could do that in terms of like we've got the richest politician in every state um we have the these there's all sorts of stats on this but like the average income of somebody in Congress versus the general public is so disparate um we could talk about um the representation of sexuality do we have anybody and you know Sven Robertson in Canada first openly um a gay man who was elected to office and increasingly we have uh trans and people uh with different sexualities being elected all over the world um heads of state and all the rest of this if we have a Democratic Society do we want that as proportional um citizenship status right back to the original question of this Athenian democracy we have Medics who who get to teach us about democracy but don't get to vote in the systems we have um residency how long should you be able to be in an area and what should require you to vote do we want one person one vote what if people have two houses what if you are at school during the school year and go home for the rest of the year is your permanent residence the place I mean technically in Canada permanent residence where you live 60 of the time you should vote where your permanent residences which means you should be voting in London should you be voting in London Municipal elections off-cycle elections and if you are the people who live in London full-time versus the students who are there for four years are their votes the same um we can do this in terms of gender equality so like these this is Canada US Mexico Canada and Mexico are much better on gender equality than the US so if we're going back to gerrymandering or radical democracy in terms of gender outcomes this is awful it doesn't even require that you're gerrymandering we don't have that um an income right so should the people who are being elected be in the same income bracket should they reflect that bottom 50 percent because they don't they just objectively don't it's it's not capable of doing so and so when we're thinking about radical democracy we need to think Beyond this category of voting as being radically Democratic because the the category of Citizen themselves can be much more inclusive if we're trying to get more representative structures right and the only way that that happens is not by picking the same leaders over and over again it's by being unruly and demanding ways in which we do it it requires Justice requires an expansion of the idea of what is fair right not the the agreement that this system is already fair and so contesting Injustice is at the heart of liberal Democratic Society but you wouldn't know it from this textbook chapter um because we don't have any understanding of where those injustices come from and we don't have a theory of the violence that is created by those systems and structures such as these producing all of these inequalities from the liberal Democratic premise of one person one vote or from the idea that citizens should have the right to vote and other bodies shouldn't be represented in those structures and so it the radical Democratic position again I don't know who this is but um is the idea the freedom to do more than vote speak and organize um that we should have you know different levels of government do different things and talk about different issues and so we would need to have representative representation in all those structures and we know and we know that in Western liberal democracies they both disproportionately favor agricultural region regions they are overrepresented in all kind of liberal Democratic structures and the other are overrepresented those who are aged represent are a more thoroughly represented in these Democratic structures and so why is that the liberal theorists say that's outside that's that's not part of our structures but at you know 200 years I kind of think your structure is partly responsible and so freedom to challenge and reject the status quo of politics and institutions outside formal structures challenging lawmaking rule of law and democracy itself um seems to be what radical democracy is so back to the original question of this chapter why is democracy in crisis I think the point should be democracy is always a crisis of representation so I don't get why it would just be now that it's not I guess it's the ruling structures and authorities are being challenged and the reason they're being challenged is the idea that you know that this liberal teleology of everybody just naturally reaching liberal democracy is being challenged because that bottom 50 back here they don't see the benefits of a liberal democratic system that in a literal sense in terms of their income are they better off than the generation before them or their parents are they better off than their parents know in this group and so I guess this makes me sound very Millennial but um the idea of them not being part of that group then raises questions about why they should think that liberal democracy is beneficial for them I don't see why um that that's only the case if the small minority who have benefited from it there's minority because the bottom 50 has not been um that the small minority then that benefits from the system is shocked when the group that's not benefiting from the system is saying we're not benefiting from the system let's try something else right and so the textbook write this chapter as if there's a natural teleology rather than this constant back and forth in the debate about ideas and so we as a textbook I think we want a monovocal narrative right we want to have one thing that it tells us so that you can be tested on it so that I can test you to say this is the thing you have learned that it is fact-based but if the fact is contestation it's not clear that a single Universal understanding of what modern democracy is makes sense that it's sensible we have this growing disenchantment with democracy that I can clearly demonstrate as to why and that we have seen throughout this all the way through people are constantly contesting who has citizenship and who doesn't and that our politics back to ancient Greece are about representing a small minority against the majority but then we are told over and over again that somehow the this this shouldn't impact our outcomes so this famous Princeton study in 2014 that's been contested all over the place but the idea that the US is better understood as an oligarchy not a democracy that the concentration of how we get our information in this Society has never been more run by a small group that um we have businesses who do not have to contribute um because of systems and structures in place that we don't have to say how or why they came about but that bottom 50 is expected to contribute and those at the top who are in that that big growth part don't have to that the number of billionaires in the period just from 1990 not back to 1975 from 1990 to 2020 has gone from 66 to 614. so these systems and structures are becoming more unequal and yet the textbook is somehow surprised that we're challenging liberal democracy you can look at this like the amount then is that the parties are spending in those structures in order to get votes is is billions of dollars and that the billionaires then contribute more and more to those billions of dollars so that the politicians back to this question that this Princeton study came up with said that the donors to the political parties are more likely to have their policies represented than those who vote so if yid is not and if it is an oligarchy not a democracy then it's weird again these are all political donors in the Fortune 500 tend to be the similar ones that pay less taxes at like a Microsoft than others um and then this idea that democracy and crisis is somehow unpredictable it doesn't make any sense oh the meme didn't show were we tried nothing and we're all out of ideas that the liberal premise can't figure out the ideas of why liberalism and democracy are being challenged it's disenchantment with a process that clearly isn't manifesting in specific outcomes for the bulk of the population and so we see these specifically expressed um Occupy Wall Street I don't know more missing and murder indigenous women black lives matter those groups that listen they're definitely part of that bottom 50 but they're part of that bottom 50 remember Dubois said that whiteness is a psychological wage it allows one group of people to think they're Superior to another even though in all material terms they live grew in the exact same area and they're just as poor as one another they're just as well I know they're just as poor they're the bottom 50 they're just as poor as one another but then they utilize those mechanisms as forms of hierarchy and control as if hierarchy and control matters it's the carrying of this issue so there is a a relationship here to the disenfranchisement with the process because they're not seeing benefits from it that then results in forms of contestation as we've seen all along and so the idea of the year in protest and millions of protesters across different continents this satisfaction with politicians and democracy itself and I mean the textbook thinks it's inexplicable I I tend to say that it's not really that hard to figure out and there's a slide towards a liberalism around the world because even though the you know the the beacon on the hill America was always seen as the beacon on the hill the exceptional model that we could Aspire towards posts um 911 it's hard to see it as a beacon on the hill and Guantanamo Bay still exists right as a as a illiberal prison you can call it that um and so this slide towards illiberalism then is is a broad-based it's got support um and it's broad-based because these structures aren't being required to impose greater democracy um and so we have the rise of these far-right parties that are pitting one group that might not be getting ahead against another group that might not be getting ahead um and so the question isn't I I don't think it's that people or don't see the value of democracy I think it's the Democracy isn't demonstrating their value to the people and so if democracy isn't being Democratic and I can demonstrate that it's not being Democratic the problem is democracy itself it's not the people being upset with it and so um you know I like I said I don't really want to get into this um all of a sudden it's inexplicable that during the pandemic people who don't see benefits um and for example I mean many like the trades and and you know probably some of you having to work at grocery stores we're just like throw those people we're gonna all stay at a home but those people who work in the trades and the jobs that we can't have they just go out there well we're willing to risk their lives um and so these have to disproportionate impacts on the poor and the vulnerable not randomly right like compounded by existing inequalities and marginalized communities yeah um underscored the critical role of government in mobilizing resources and protecting citizens that's what they took from that I I okay they took from this contestation around all of these issues that the government needs more resources I I yeah I said I can't even this doesn't link to any of those previous arguments it doesn't make a ton of sense to me um doesn't make a ton of sense to me so much so I wrote a freaking chapter on it uh because it doesn't make any sense to me it's ABS you cannot understand how the responses to covet happened without understanding the role of markets the world of race and the production of ignorance by those minority in group who are just shocked when things don't go the way that they thought they would and so when we're talking about democracy in crisis I maybe um we call them racial Injustice movements in Canada I think we need to distinguish between um settlement and race um specifically in Canada we have long used the idea of let's bring in um settler populations immigrant populations from throughout the Commonwealth and abroad unsettler territory and then be like well what do you mean these people just got here they're not involved in the problems and structures that are involved in the settlement uh repression that's gone on since the origins of Canadian the Canadian State um anyways I I'm not going to get into it we'll get into it much later in the course and throughout the course I don't want to get into it now what I would say is the Democracy in crisis is as much about democracy has always been in crisis than anything else we have lots of examples they change the conversations about State violence sure I mean but I'm pretty sure those communities have always had these conversations um respectability politics have been around forever right no use reasonable discussion to make your arguments to a majority population and if that majority population votes for the minority then we'll give you those rights it's been fundamentally flawed since ancient Greece and calls for better forms of democracy sure uh contrast with attack on the U.S Capitol Building again I don't know what you think like I think they were in favor of what they thought democracy was is that I get to vote as a majority and I get my interests upheld and then when that structure starts breaking apart we're shocked that the people who were given this psychological wage of feeling Superior no longer feel Superior and they Rebel um I I don't know I don't know what that stuff is I'm not interested in kind of having those discussions um what we need to to the conclusions of the chapter fine we can trace the idea of democracy or contestation all the way back politics of democracy all the way back to ancient Greece um government and process have been more inclusive I mean I guess so I think religious Authority believing that you're not going to you're going to literally go to hell if you don't participate in our systems and structures seems a bit more invasive but sure um future of democracy is contested and uncertain yes I think it always has been I think the idea that it disappeared and didn't show back up that disappeared in in ancient Greece and didn't show up until the 14 17 1800s probably a good indication that it's always contested and uncertain um and there's all those reasons uh why that that is the case and I I don't disagree with any of those all right um that is the end of democratic ideas um I tried to be a sympathetic but sometimes I just get frustrated with the assumptions that we're not being critical about our critical ideas um so yeah that's it
