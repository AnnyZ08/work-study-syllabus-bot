 um so one more before we get into the context of um the history and ideas um Hobson's been doing a lot of work John hopson's been doing a lot of work in looking back on the ways in which political science as a discipline has thought about its encounters or its relationships um to the non-west specifically the ways in which um he's got a great bunch of great books on this that documents how very similar to what Saeed is doing with orientalism and saying that those who are studying these things are constantly using non-western ideas and Frameworks in order to reinforce the Western idea and Frameworks they're linked to them together and so this idea of a passive bystander to the progressive West it's just not factually true it's just a narrative I guess a story that is told in order to reproduce the idea of modernity exceptionalism and development um it just downplays the ways in which Eastern influences have been here all along in international relations which is what I studied the Bandung conference in 1955 is an integral way in which kind of everything about the colonial experience has reshaped human rights are reshaped they're articulated clearly and the West just ignores it just ignores it for 40 years and then we ReDiscover it even though it's a constant reference point so there have always been Muslim contributions to modern science um reasoning that's vital to the Western Renaissance Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment we have lots of ways in which we can identify the role of Persian astronomers and mathematicians generating calendars geometric formula solving equations all this stuff recognizing these questions and so Hobson's work is helping us to to kind of recover the ways in which politics has been situated in terms of your eccentricism was constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries uh way before 1957 year zero so he's saying here that even the concept of eurocentricism is itself a kind of a modern construct that we don't think right we just and there are four key points I just want to specify here by where summary first of all I want to call this paternalist eurocentrism I actually seen two forms of your essentialism anti-personalist which is Anti-Imperialist and paternalist geocentrism which is imperialist and given that much of Liberty so paternalism so using traditional structures of patriarchy to speak down to to say that this is permissible or not again that's a very paternalist way for me to say that an international Theory they're not all of it um suffers from what I call paternalist your essentialism let me therefore I guess we could call it mansplaining just focus on that the first point you're a centrism in an effect constructs a kind of bipolar what I call a bipolar line of civilizational apartheid between East and West right East and West are radically separated out they're prized apart they were always overlapping the eurocentrism priced them apart and then rarefied them into self-constituting entities second there was then created a hierarchy so West was seen as inherently best over the rest and the East was the West's inferior opposite other the West and the 18th and 19th centuries as indeed today was proclaimed as civilized in this discourse because it's institutions and its culture were said to be rational while the East institutions were deemed to be irrational so you've got this bipolarity upon that over overlaid upon that is a sort of tripartite if you like meta geography if if you allow me to use that rather pompous academic term and this talks about three worlds three worlds of world politics so the first world is the West up till 1945 the West was really Europe and it was deemed to be civilized had Russian institutions had liberal Democratic states liberal capitalism individualism science so on and so forth the second world was that of Oriental despotic States okay gargantuan autocracies with squash and suppress their own civil societies and wage war internationally these are clearly uncivilized especially compared to the west or Europe but they are more advanced than the Savage societies The Savage societies are effectively anarchic black holes where comprising hunter-gatherers no sedentary economy no science just Voodoo and magic and witchcraft and then the scientific racists basically bought into this but they gave the whole thing a nice color scheme she had the white West the yellow second world the yellow barbaric East East Asia the Islamic world and no prices for guessing the uh third one that's the black Savage world of Africa australasia and Polynesia uh right this this meta narrative was then developed within the paternalist stream into an imperialist Politics the anti-personist didn't do this Adam Smith Emmanuel Kant but paternalists did do this and basically what they said is that Eastern societies Nissan peoples are capable of developing but that they have become blocked by irrational institutions and it is The White Man's Burden it is the duty of the west of Europe to go out there and save them from their own um the rational institutions which oppress them and this will be delivered through the Western civilizing mission uh Eastern peoples particularly black peoples were thought of through a kind of Peter Pan metaphor nice innocent people who never grow up of their own accord so it was a duty of the West to go over there through the civilizing mission deliver the rational institution so that they too could grow up and mature into a developmental path that would be a realized with their arrival at the end of History namely a European civilization so I find this fascinating I'm going to let it keep running I'm not sure how much everybody else finds this fascinating I do want him to get to the next point so that we can move on with the discussion Amounts is pretty much the same he just added in another stage it was called communism but the same kind of mentality emergency fourth this discourse implies does not imply a world of sovereign states what we actually have is a discourse where western states are in effect awarded what I call hyper sovereignty that is the right the legitimacy to intervene in in various societies and the Eastern societies are strict of sovereignty they have no sovereignty because they're not civilized so they can't be allowed the privilege of external non-intervention and finally underlying this whole discourse is the notion that the West Rose to the top Europe Rose to the top all by itself through a kind of logic of imminence with modernization and the arrival of modernity was imminent within Europe's social structure it was imminent because Europe is exceptional just like today the Americans believe that they are truly exceptional and so in all stories of the rise of the West whether you look at Max Weber Karl Marx whoever you want to look at the argument is an effect that Europe and the West is a kind of self-made Global millionaire who got to the top as a result of his own exceptional institutions and the yeast was imagined as a kind of Sleeping Beauty awaiting the time when our dashing Western Prince would arrive to awaken her from her Slumber with a gentle kiss that gentle kiss there's of course the civilizing mission I'm not so sure if it was quite as gentle as that in practice but that was the idea your essentially modern liberal International Theory let me just um okay so I've got to stop him there I would let him go on but um the ways in which these stories get retold in very simple ways and common ways is really what he's outlining the we don't get to the second move here he spends a lot he's got to hold books on just spending like he goes through every single academic and and talks about how they do this I've got maps and charts but it would be boring the idea here is simply that this this reproduced notion just isn't true it's a he has a bunch of myths on this um one I mean he said them also I'm not going to go over them too much but it's just the idea that that you know that the emergence of kind of modernity happens without imperialist conquest and the Scramble for Africa that objectivity isn't situated in a historical context for example the part of the premise of the Vietnam War was the Domino Theory right that if Vietnam went communist uh spoiler alert it did the rest of Asia would fall in the west would no longer have influence just wasn't true and so actions were taken based on assertions that these analyzes were objective they weren't um these idea the great debates were hugely different between the U.S and Soviet systems not really um the idea that there weren't Sovereign forms of authority that should be recognized as legitimate um that globalization is just Western opportunity um not forms of paternalism and and racism um we do this in the the you know the East Asian development models um there's lots of discussions of this in political economy um and then idea these these great Traditions which to be clear our texts have largely reproduced in the ways that things that we've looked at and so what we need to start talking about is the ways in which some of those other ideas uh come in maybe I'll do this right now so my Lebanese stepmother always wanted me to read call dude so much all the time it's it's because it's so incisive and provides so many insights right so um the idea of of having a 14th century social scientist developing this idea of studying State and society as the interplay of political and economic factors um rather than you know these kind of imminent factors as he as Hobson talks about about how social change happens so understanding this as civilizational but not in a way that reproduces the Civilized versus the uncivilized but the different cultural Logics that play in in economic and political um factors so looking at reason as a way as this kind of social way of organizing forms of improvement right and the way in which social solidarity is formed the way in which culture is Thoroughly framed in terms of of these Politics the way that reason provides an explanatory principle of intelligibility sound familiar that this us I'm butchering that is essential to have the creation of the state as a higher form of collective existence again very similar to the stuff that comes out in the 1800s in Europe that the key Insight that's totally been lost is the way in which culture shapes State forms and the development of each state contains within it the seeds of its own destruction which is key right like you can think about the ways in which China has emerged as such a briteral political infrastructure that absolutely has fostered economic growth and development but is so brittle and that we've seen the ways in which it is and so I don't know why we have to use Cox to read kaldum but whatever the idea here is Robert Cox says that we have to think about the challenges to modernity to that have always been there and that will always be there and that are bound up in this the idea of social inequality polarization the role of the state and religion and Trust so remember I keep saying that we talk about political success instead of failure here's a framework that actually talks about failure as part of success and so so we have this long tradition and you would understand why when you have changing political structures changing cultural structures that you're going to develop a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between Power Authority and its eventual failure rather than all of these texts which just speak to princes as if that's politics right and so promoting ideas like economic and social equality provides stability in ways that we don't conceptualize like we have totally lost in the west and then the kind of revolutionary teachings then especially when it comes to Liberation theology and there's a long history of Liberation theology and the Haitian revolution taking the French revolutionaries insights and applying it to race are all parts of kind of provincializing the way in which things have been done and so um actually I'll stop it there and we'll do this in the next specifically in the relationship to the Islamic revolution and how that is a modern Revolution but we don't like to frame it that way because of the ways that we've conceptualized our relationship to the Persian and Iranian traditions
