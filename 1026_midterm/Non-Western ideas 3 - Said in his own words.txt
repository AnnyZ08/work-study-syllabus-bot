 so here's just a clip this came up as one of the uh first interviews I found I'll leave it in because it's I mean it's apropos of just Google Charlie Rose the interviewer here because he comes across with so much respect or whatever canceled me too um so this is just um so you'd talking this is at the end of it's like talking about these the kind of the idea of translation and and this relationship um between the kind of cultural values and the and the ways in which we think it's you know just sort of two different uh not really worlds but they're just two sets of expectation many many sets of expectations and languages that have very little in common different value all can be bridged in my opinion I I in other words I don't think the crisis is simply a crisis of misunderstanding I think that there is a lot that can be done by people who are familiar with both cultures in both worlds and that can you know can interpret one to the other I think that's been very very lacking why well it's a long history of it I I think the Islamic and Arab world has historically been um because of its adjacents to Europe and the West it's always been felt as a threat oh there's been a great Colonial interest in that part of the world you know now because of oil and strategy and it's it's felt to be also centrally important because of the holy places not just in Palestine but also of course in in Saudi Arabia for Muslims it's such the whole area is saturated with all kinds of significance everybody claims some uh part of it you know historically or or actually and I think you know the the there's also tremendous disparity in in mode of life and trajectory people are going in One Direction and they go in another Direction in another part of the world and there's been a long and deep-seated conflict which is which a lot of it comes from ignorance and misunderstanding some will say as Tom Friedman did today talking in India also democracy it makes them different that freedom and democracy would have been a powerful stimulus in the Arab world I I you know I've been I'm second to none in my criticism of the absence of democracy I know you are in the Arab world you know it's been very bad yeah and and you you've been also second to none in terms of a Palestinian yes uh in your criticism of the Palestinian Authority yes absolutely for those reasons yeah and the other subs as well I mean the Egyptians all of them right I've taken them all out I think that that is a great problem but but I think you know another problem I think is the fact that most Americans now speaking from this side um haven't really quite understood what the priorities and what the feelings and issues are for people in that part of the world or at least they don't take them seriously enough I mean that these are matters of great moment and issue to people uh and one of them I think is Palestine I mean the sense of Palestine to most Arabs is a central and now deeply symbolic thing the Palestinians are suffering that they are simply prevented from attaining their self-determination and statehood that they go through this daily ordeal under Israeli occupation for for years 35 years now is a source of tremendous well I think it's a source of tremendous I did want to step in that yet so let's just back off for a minute I'm more than happy to talk about it I just don't think we've set it up properly to have that discussion yet what I I think is important is talking about symbolism and I mean clearly how the interviewer wants to steer it towards Western concerns and then he tries to steer it back away to concerns from the region um and I'm not saying that these issues are important I'm just saying we need to set them up we can't just jump in I would tell you that in general if you're going to start talking about these things you need to contextualize you need to make sure that your your thought is well prepared before you start in on it because yeah for all the reasons but anyways that that's a bit of Syed him talking about this these kind of cultural and intellectual tradition and he's he's walking back and forth you know to the code switching discussion of last time walking between this idea of the way that things are conceptualized in the west and that these groups and ideas and opinions are considered secondary but in those regions their primary and these concerns of the West are secondary and so he believes that that can be overcome uh he's probably more optimistic than I am about some of those things but that's that's fine um all right so that's a bit aside and we'll move on
