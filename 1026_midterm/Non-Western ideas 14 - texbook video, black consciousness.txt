 so effectively this lecture could be just called Dan reacts um but I do think it is important to react to these I think it's important because this is the first time I am engaging with these well not all of these clearly but um the first time I had some of these videos I'm seeing and the first time that we can do these because then it allows us to all experience it new at the same time and so this is uh the video from the online text at the end and then um like yeah I think this will just let it speak for yourself I'm Louis Gordon author of fear of black consciousness you may ask what is the fear of black Consciousness well the fear of black Consciousness is the fear of Truth it's a truth in which black people are recognized treated and understand ourselves as agents of history and as agents of History we also are able to live our freedom with dignity and respect but in a white supremacist and an anti-black Society there's another fear and that fear is that the realization of dignity and respect for black people is a world in which white supremacists and anti-black racists have become irrelevant there's also another issue and there's a debt other issue is related to how people tend to talk about black people because you see many people think they're black people are the black people and what is ignored is the black they said black people who are in South America in countries like Brazil Colombia All Over the Caribbean where we have the largest populations of black people in this side of the Atlantic what is often ignored is the complexity of black peoples in Africa but also in South Asia for instance when we think about the Dali population so those in Pacific uh uh the Pacific Islands and across the globe or even the complicated histories of Scandinavia France or in the very fact that in Iberia in Portugal and in Spain we have what created the Euro modern world through which we think of black people today so as I look across the globe from the South Pacific through Asia where there's dalit population all the way through to the complexity of what we see in the Scandinavian countries what we may see happen in the very history of the formation of the Euro modern world and race in Iberia where you have Portugal and Spain or even the complexity of how we think about Russia and the Circadian populations we begin to understand that to talk about what it is to be black in consciousness is also to talk about Euro modern and African history and this includes even the Mythic versions as I talk about in my discussion of wakanda with the famed Black Panther so to address these issues I explore through this book The difficult terrain the difficult terrains for which there is a form of white narcissism that makes one as an agent of History exclusively white or at least not black and this often guises itself as color blindness I show that this is a lie this is a form of bad faith and as I unmasked this lie and go through its terrain I do so through examining also a very difficult question and that is the question in which to be white and to live in everyday life is also one in which there's a profound license over the lives of others you see many many other people in the world live each day with the realization that just to be able to get through the day as an ordinary day is an extraordinary achievement and that extraordinary achievement is so precisely because of what it is to live under white dominated societies this then this achievement of being able to live as agents of History requires a political commitment and a creative practice richly layered through ART love and ultimately revolutionary action okay no comments sure um yeah I mean I think that even though wakanda stuff Echoes kind of what the textbook was arguing and that's probably why they included it at the end of the textbook um yeah these are all the questions um yeah provincializing ideas sure that's all straightforward and these are the things uh Camp Encino we didn't talk about here but we have talked about before as peasant movements peasant organizations uh textbook says it talks about feminism I think we'll get into it the next couple weeks when we start dealing with identity more uh I don't like the way in which we have taken feminism out of the theories these ideas um that there's a lack of bodies here and specifically in this chapter a lack of of women um and so yeah I I would like to see more of that and like let's be clear we haven't even got into I will get into lgbtq but like the the queer phenomenology queer questions that that also challenge the normativity bound up at a lot of these claims okay um that's it for non-western ideas uh
