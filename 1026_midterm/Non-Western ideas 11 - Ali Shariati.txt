 okay so I do have a video on ali sharayati 
um a 20th century Iranian thinker um   framing the the video does a better job 
of explaining than the text or this does   the framing this the ideas of egalitarianism and 
um the history of kind of political thought and   the politicization of religious traditions 
in order to achieve political goals and so   this idea of you know history has const as 
contradictions and this kind of relationship   between Generations so intergenerational 
conflict which are intergenerational Justice   is is all the rage right now and that um the 
idea of having this conflict as producing   and you can see how this could be um influenced 
by specific Marxist readings too is is a battle   that ends in the Triumph of True Justice 
and Equity so um we'll we'll show this   because this behind it lay the ideas of a 
young Iranian teacher called Ali shariati   Sharia so this voice is a classic documentary 
voice that I am deeply suspicious of this framing   but we'll use it because it's available on YouTube 
and it's uh from an Afrocentric power Channel   tea is an extraordinary historical figure because 
he single-handedly fused the ideas of Sean Paul   Sartre and France fanel with Shia Isla to produce 
a completely new revolutionary ideology and it was   this ideology that lay behind Ayatollah Harmony's 
radical vision of political Islam [Music]   like so many revolutions shariati 
had studied in Paris in the early 60s   and he had become fascinated by satra's 
ideas of true freedom theories of how to   use armed struggle to achieve it shariati 
translated both Fano and satra into Farsi   what he added to their theories was 
the idea that Shia Islam could be used   to give meaning and purpose to the armed 
struggle and the Utopia it would achieve   this was a radically new interpretation since the 
seventh century Shia Islam had been an apolitical   and passive Force its leaders the ayatollahs 
told the people that they must not involve   themselves in political struggle they should 
wait patiently and endure all hardships until   the coming of the true what was that image 
doing there oh my God this is so anyways but shariati had turned Shia Islam into 
a revolutionary political force that yet   again offered to liberate people and 
transform them in the Here and Now because these ideas had taken up 
and used to overwhelm America's Ally   and in the slogans shouted 
on the streets in Tehran   what you hear are the Western ideas of 
positive Liberty theories of France funnel [Music] so so you see the the double move there to both   um say that the West is responsible but also 
not responsible for everything that happens   it's just it's so much it's so heavily coded all 
of these ways in which we produce meaning and then   the who gets to produce the meaning is the way the 
meaning is interpreted um and yeah it's just messy
