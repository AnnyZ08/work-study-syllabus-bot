 all right so let's get back to the radical ideas um this is socialism so um you know socialism communism fascisms and capitals we'll go through all the types um there are many different types of socialism I don't know why we said this sure we can say whatever they're all traced to Rousseau's critique of property the organic society and what constitutes security good okay we don't need any supporting evidence or any foundation for that but sure let's do that um okay so there's three types that they talk about here utopian scientific and Social Democratic so um utopian socialism uh again I don't know how you would have this discussion but they're talking about capitalism first so capitalism establishes private property rights so it becomes the thing that socialism is critiquing right so it says that we need public ownership how do you have ownership you have to have ownership so ownership would then be something that has been entrenched either by the state or by the Monarch or whoever says they own the land at Crown lands right um and so public ownership would mean that it's it's something like a Commons I guess but we would still have to designate who would get access and so you know it was always public ownership when the state owns it but it's public ownership because everybody gets access to it okay sure um Democratic social institution sure we can talk about those I've got an example we'll talk about a minute participatory budgeting so instead of having resources allocated arbitrarily we have the people participate in forms of um allocating resources the eradication of want um okay maybe I I really want a cheeseburger um so what's the difference between want to need this is one of the the capitalist assumptions is that there is no difference between one need now there's definitely a difference between need when I need oxygen or need water or I need access to clean drinking water or I will get diarrhea and die as I think is the number of three or four killer of children around the world um and so you know there are certainly biological needs but we also have like a human right to food differentiation because humans need food that's not the same human right to shaving human right to menstrual products um I mean we've just recently stopped taxing menstrual products as if menstrual products were just a they were a wants not a need right so the ways in which want to need is framed is very much socially conditioned um and so they use examples uh communes agricultural co-ops and public housing sure okay fine here's some participatory budgeting interesting idea people participate in Italy capital of tiny Estonia asked its inhabitants to propose ideas on how to spend 1 million euro of its Municipal budget residents came up with 132 ideas proposing to add more recycling layers build Community Gardens and playgrounds and install an outdoor gym they also asked for more benches and drinking fountains this month everyone aged above 14 was called to vote on these ideas to decide which project they want to implement in their District so look okay we can get into Talent Talon is very interesting place um it's kind of center of cyber security but um yeah participatory budget but allowing 14 year olds to participate because they are going to enjoy many of these things wondering what this process is here's the name participatory budgeting [Music] stock footage I don't know why We're translating Europe sure and there's experiments in participatory budgeting is becoming some sort of buzzword in Democratic circles more and more European cities are adopting the ideas Civil Society organizations are pushing for it but what exactly is participatory budgeting well it's the shared decision between local government and citizens on how to spend a part of the municipal budget in practice cities ask their inhabitants to decide where to invest their money so how does it work there's no one-size-fits all every city can use a different approach to participatory budgeting but there are some common aspects to the process the first step is always organization and planning cities need to decide how they want to give a voice to the residents and what percentage of the budget will be dedicated to Citizen initiatives they also need to inform their inhabitants to make sure that people will actually participate during the second phase a citizen came up with ideas and negotiated with government players to decide where to allocate the locker resources and the third step is implementation the city takes note of what citizens ask for and makes sure that these projects are carried out let's take Thailand for instance in August the city council started to prepare the participatory budgeting process in September residents were called to submit their ideas in October and November these ideas were evaluated and selected for their feasibility by an expert committee and in the first half of December citizen work called to vote on the initiative they wanted for their District finally next year the city will implement the most supported project for each district Stalin is a good example of how participatory budgeting works so you know this is a very clear example but we don't have any examples in the text of what this is this could be framed as a socialist plot it largely just seems as forms Democratic participation but did Democratic participation in the allocation of resources is by definition here utopian socialism I guess so as long as we keep it to one percent if it's 51 percent is that socialist you know the sure um so this is what I'm saying like if you want to dismiss ideas do it in a boring way um so here we've got Scientific Socialism so this is a specific framing of of historical materialism um again those words already make you shut off your brain largely based on Western ideas of rationality and science um we could do it in a more kind of specific way it's pretty easy here's historical materialism right here the oil sector for the last 50 years has made three billion dollars a day I wonder what they've done with that I'm sure they've just sat on it and not used it in any way to influence political outcomes to make sure that that three billion dollars a day doesn't continue to be three billion dollars a day historical materialism why they are changing the course of history with their material capabilities this is a really easy example we don't have any examples of the text um and so you know capitalism as a mode of production creates class antagonisms between the bourgeoisie and proletariat I've got an easier example of this um it's right here this is the Bastion of capitalism uh producing in a market system Supply where it's got inelastic demand because you need insulin or you die um capitalism framesa says uh want socialism would frame this as need hence all of those countries understand it as need and intervened to make sure that it doesn't become just a want because this by definition could kill people if they don't have access to it or as there were cases of people trying to make their own insulin or using their dog's insulin which is not designed for people but because they couldn't afford it so yeah when we're talking about historical materialism we could make it more radical if we provide a little bit of data so I guess we don't provide any data so it doesn't seem radical at all and so we frame it as things like workers are commodified to produce Surplus value for capitalists this is the labor theory of value which has huge problems unless you're a specific brand of marxist that I've run into that insists that it's still True to this day you do you right okay um and that workers will eventually revolt and overthrow capitalism that this is something that both socialists and Communists believe um they tend to predict what is it they predict seven of everyone actually crises that happen they constantly predict that crises will happen and then people will rise up and overthrow the system uh it largely discounts all that other ideological stuff we talked about earlier um you know I think of that as more Marxist not socialist per se because socialists are trying to work within capitalism you know do the stuff around the engines the municipal stuff Marxist want to overthrow the system and see it as that but sure let's let's call this Scientific Socialism um this is just another critique of this idea that that's referenced as like Net Zero um this is just a criticism of net zero this is the ways in which that three billion dollars is deployed so it's it's not we've been through this uh we did Corporate social responsibility we have ESG environmentally sustainable governance um and now we're into the Net Zero these are different ways of green washing the ways in which fossil fuel Industries um try to say that they are helping in global climate change we have everybody BP shell Microsoft Apple Amazon Walmart BlackRock United in Delta Delta Nestle and Cargill JBS all saying they're they're trying to do Net Zero 1500 corporations say they want to do Net Zero um why because the two Meg vague to mean anything it disguises their intent to ramp up emissions intensive Productions it relies on distractions it's ignorative science and logic uh just basic physics can't have more without putting more inputs in um and investment status quo the math doesn't make sense it results in profit over people in the planet and it rejects systemic change and so we get situations like this where um where the political structures because they're so heavily embed invested in these systems you know billions of dollars every year go to to subsidies of fossil fuels um I I we were talking about one last year just um as people are shifting off of natural gas um for example the natural gas provision gets caught in this death spiral that's what they're calling it Enbridge is calling this in Ontario where um if people are moving away from from traditional fossil fuels they're no longer going to have the same revenues in order to maintain the system so those who continue to be on it will end up paying more and more which inevitably is those who can't afford it which are people poor elderly or unable to change their Reliance on natural gas because it's expensive to retrofit your house that's why the governments are trying to support it so what then Enbridge is saying to the government is if you want us to maintain this system and you don't want us to pass on the prices to everybody else you're going to have to give us subsidies so the structures are in place that have been built with this three billion dollars a day over the last 50 years to do these things where you end up with like the pope being more radical than the Democrats are we willing to call the pope a radical now this is where we end up when we we do this stuff so I mean the really easy examples to talk about materialism some banks make 30 billion dollars in overdraft fees that means they're literally taking 30 billion dollars away from Port that's an easy example I don't it's a it's it's sorry it's a tweet right it's a tweet uh how we don't have any evidence for these ideas and how we try to produce them as boring as possible is the weirdest de-radicalization of radical politics right and so what we get then is um you know the third variation is democratic Socialism or social democracy shares a critique of capitalism but calls for evolutionary change rather than revolutionary change the UN is a Fabian socialist institution Fabian was a famous military commander who instead of directly attacking their enemy his enemy uh surrounded the city and cut off its supply lines and so um uh Fabian fabianism or Fabian socialism says we're not going to directly challenge capitalism we're going to slowly you know chip away at it um as we go so you can do this with the UN the youns of Fabian socialist institution it says oh my God look at all the consequences of these terrible things that we're doing how should we fix them well that's up to individual states so it's never going to challenge any of the systems that currently uh exist it's going to say you have human rights and because you have human rights it's a state obligation to it to protect those human rights um global climate change is real these are things that need to be done we need to take radical and drastic change immediately what radical drastic changes we're not going to say we're not cutting off that three billion dollars a day we're not touching that we are just saying that it needs to uh it needs to be done we're not going to tell you how to do them right and so it's very much mixed public-private Enterprise a robust social welfare programs and policies Grassroots decision makings CCF NDP I maybe I think this is most liberal democracies honestly I and some people don't want to call it socialism I guess because it it's because we're seeding territory to to the the people who get to set the receding territory to groups when we let them Define the words that we use and how we use them right so do what you want right um but this idea of socialism I I consider the Socialists like I can we can critique socialism and those who argue against socialism right fire departments so socialism we should leave this to the free market libertarian Spider-Man um so yeah socialism as per the textbook
