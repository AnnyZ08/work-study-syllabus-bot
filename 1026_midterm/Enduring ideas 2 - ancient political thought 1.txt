 so um this will be the ancient beginnings of Western political philosophy can we call it ancient if I'm teaching it on YouTube in uh uh the 2020s I don't know whatever um so the idea here is that I don't know some people sure divide political philosophy into ancient and modern I I again I don't know um the ancient Greek and Western theorists the argument here is that it it's better to read them as full text so I don't know what a textbook is then we're not doing proper work I I would just go back to litera as this book called we will we have never been modern um and it always you know it's it's the obsession with the new makes us think that the new is better and so weirdly enough like I'm using a current textbook because some of the complaints were and I wasn't happy with the the age of the previous textbook I was using so I'm I'm just as guilty as anybody else of thinking the modern is better but the idea here is just because it's new doesn't make it better it's the re-articulation of that in different contexts and ideas and so we would say that the re-articulation of something that's been around for a long time and different contexts would seem to have important relevance right so that's fine um so the centrality of of the polis in ancient um kind of Athenian political culture was the idea that there was you know this this this notion that cooperation or common good is better than individual gain um and so we want to to frame this kind of tension between the the social and the individual the self-interest versus Collective interest and where does collective Interest come from right so like we saw in the video this idea that there's benefit from cooperation and that we actually all benefit from working together rather than acting in our own interest um and so politics then is a moral activity because it is one that not just is directed at at yourself it's directed at others ethics is directed at this itself morality is directed at others um you know and it's the idea that there's somehow it's Noble to to make sacrifices for the individual to have Collective ends and so this has always been one of the tensions of of um politics and political office is that there is intense power in political office and if you have self-interested people in positions of political Authority does this result in corruption and corrosion of the public good and pursuit makes everyone pursue individual self-interest it's corrosive right and that the idea of personal sacrifice for public good is counterintuitive to self-interest and so if we articulate that you know it's human nature to be self-interested I was going to show the friends clip but it's too white even for me um that that Phoebe and Joey argue that all actions are self-interested right and and you know this idea of no matter what you do it's self-interested um is very much based on the notion that sacrifices is something people shouldn't do or loyalty or obligation is something that is an aberration from the norm and so the idea is here come back from Pericles and this idea that that we should encourage people to fall in love with their city so that they have I don't know what kind of love that would be but hey I'll come back to it later but the idea of you know fans or um the Coliseum or sport is the idea that you have an intense personal identification with something that is bigger than yourself right and so this you know this city love is it could be or similar to patriotism to to fandom to fanaticism this idea now that we've got with influencers that we are embedded in the kind of the social life world of them and so we become you know fans of specific influencers and then you know we organize our lives around them you know the swifties all the rest of it um and so when we're thinking about these things we we talk about the ideas here that Pericles pushed this idea that it's important to have something that's that's more than yourselves and have sacrifice and love and something that's greater than your individual interests but the instant that those people who Advocate those values disappear we see that you know this the city com collapses into Warfare and financial ruin so that the idea of Might making right or Instinct over judgment um results in you know terrible outcomes so the idea that democracy was dissolved eventually in a coup d'etat results on this idea that these are persistent themes that we see that we can either choose to act in the common interests of others or act for the betterment of others because it also benefits ourselves or we can say no one is acting that way I'm not going to act that way and so these become this is one of the fundamental problems of political science is that it's an open-ended not a closed system so a closed system you could say everyone pursues self-interest it results in in terrible outcomes everyone pursues beneficial good it results in positive outcomes the problem is that excuse me in politics we always have a mixture of the two and so it's the degree to which we are doing one or the other that that impacts things and so this idea of of the story of Pericles is the story like the the Great Law of Peace one that tells us we make choices about um how we deal with those who are self-interested or or publicly interested how we make sense of the world how we understand common sense and everybody's individual experience as they they did in the the Great Law of Peace story those with intense trauma can respond to that trauma with being self-interested more making or they can respond to that saying I never want this to happen to anybody else right and so the good life the common good the individual actions in a corrupt context then become this this tension between um ethics and morality so what should an individual do when confronted with terrible circumstances well you can try to rise above it or you can you know fall down to the the basement of it and so the idea of oligarchy then of seizing power after War is that you know good people should pursue the rule for others not themselves they shouldn't see this but this is dismissed as as naive and so their perception of self-interest degradates or undermines the idea of public service and you know there's this tension that back to what we talked about last time with the iron law of oligarchy is that even those pursuing public good are actually pursuing self-good by doing public goods so you can always denigrate this people who see the world in self-interested terms just assume everybody Who's acting um in uh the public interest or doing so in a self-interest way and vice versa right that even those who are self-interested must see the benefit of of doing those other things so coming to ancient political thought then we we can deal with the idea of the Republic like the Socrates in Plato in this the Plato's Republic centers on these left these lessons that come from Athens interestingly they're constructed as a dialogue between you know Plato's teacher and Socrates in this back and forth and we don't do that when we do political Theory we do univocal not polyvoker dialogical I'm not sure why that's the case part of the reason and I'm having to deal with this in thinking about chat GPT is that you know if if an AI can do all the the assessment and learning for you what is it to learn and part of what it is to learn is to engage in dialogues right that we learn from dialogues and so this idea of moving to univocal framework is probably not the best for us to understand and so it's easier for us to understand a discussion back and forth it's easier for us to see people engaging in discussion so we can side with those people rather than just get an abstract theory of of politics and so thinking about what makes a you know a city well-ordered um in this classic tradition is thinking about the idea of that there's a division of labor right some people have the time and the circumstance to reflect on ideas others have to go and and do War making and and um that we should understand that because of there's a division of labor not everybody can do everything right um and so what stems from this then is the idea that the philosopher ruler are those who have the time to contact template should be the ones who are doing the ruling and Plato in these discussions is very ambivalent as to whether or not these could actually exist and so the practicalities of government so how would it be established should we start over this is the kind of the move of with you know what uh drove past our city hall the other day and the City Hall they had this this question when they built it was there was an existing structure there should they build it or should they just wipe it out and create a new and so because the price was the same well let's wipe it out and create a new because then we can articulate a vision of what we see as the future but in doing so we also lose the past in history and so you don't learn from it you you it's a literal form of Erasure and so we have to be conscious of the ways in which these decisions we make um do we should review it historically or should we view it abstractly uh make these questions and so they name how we think about the who should be responsible how they should be understood and what they should do and that comes back to those questions of who watches the Watchers right so who makes sure that these people don't fall into self-interest and then cause harm in the place where they're supposed to be causing public good right and so the the problem of course is about impunity those with political power have to have restraint otherwise without restraints they will act or can act in self-interest or we can't be sure that they're not acting in self-interest when they tell us that we have to do things a certain way and so the idea here is the even the ruler the Machiavellian ruler without restraint is not a very um happy way to live we can articulate it that because they're enslaved to their appetites people around them will just respect their Authority but not actually value them you know you can't abandon your position because someone else will take over that position and do what you did to them and so the idea of these these rulers who would rule in this kind of this iron-fisted way is not a beneficial way and in particular it's the transition of authority is that that type of rule is not stable because if you you know this is Game of Thrones right if you move for a second someone's trying to take the throne away from you and so it doesn't lead to a peaceful transition of power and even if you have a good leader and it's followed by a bad leader everybody loses and so there's an incentive to create these structures that there's an incentive to you know they use the example in Texas Pinochet who ruled in a in a horrible way who is accused of all sorts of war crimes who then after he was out of power um standing warrants and and efforts by the UK to arrest him for his crimes um followed him out in his his later life right so the idea here about peaceful transitions of power is a dynamic system that we tend to think of well this is liberal democracy well it's not the transition of authority from one government to the next is not automatic especially if we want to challenge the veracity of an election which let's be clear is a common strategy of the West if a government comes to power that isn't aligned with them and so thinking about these these questions then is thinking about how we can deal with these transitions um I'll stop here and then pick up um with Socrates in the next video
