 so let's talk fascism and corporatism um I again I had to supplement this a bit because I didn't feel it did an adequate job of understanding this um you know it's a an ideology right wing again the right and left thing is if we just find right in terms of defensive monarchy it doesn't make a ton of sense right um is it in terms of Power Authority it doesn't make sense in terms of this so I'm going to talk about it's it is a coherent set of ideas it involves corporatism militarism and authoritarianism has a lot of obsession with the idea of social holes and National body and it has a lot of cultism in it um and so they use the examples here of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party in Italy's National fascist party um I'll go into that in a bit the ultra nationalism I I guess they're arguing that it's nationalism on steroids um that there is an appropriate level of nationalism that's like an appropriate fan right fan comes from fnatic it by definition means extreme so nationalism is again a idea of a coherent social whole that is largely ideological right so I don't know why it would be alternationalist it's just a form of nationalism like you you get to eat it like when you come up with nationalism you have to take all the nationalism to come with it sorry that's what you do right um citizens as a collective sacrificing for the nation okay yeah we'll talk about that in a bit when we talk about Echo um belief in Aryan white supremacy we already dealt with that when we talked about um the idea of uh the Caucasian right all of these Notions again race is not linked to phenotypical characteristics because it is malleable it emerges largely after um uh we have to justify why we've included different bodies into Christianity but they aren't fully Christian and so it emerges as a concept of imperialism colonialism and it is malleable example of the Jews being in and out of whiteness Irish in and out of whiteness and then the categories are standards changing all the time and the fact that it can be deployed against white people as being ethnicized as ways to denigrate their whiteness whiteness is aspirational and incomplete and therefore it's always going to be supplemented and filled in it is not going to be a thing there is no such thing as a white whiteness is a social location that can be deployed against others it's not really a thing I don't want to get into too much anyways um I said this is better understood as National chauvinism the supremacy of one group because of their relationship to the idea they're the best right I think that makes more sense um there's some relationship to charismatic leadership um that has to do with the cult of personality stuff we saw with Communism um and some form of free enterprise that's coordinated by the state so similar to State capitalism um it involves expansionism and militarism and its use of the rule of law to consolidate and maintain power sure I agree with all those things um again I don't think it's that we can't find a co-inherent set of ideals this is from Umberto echo in 1995 called it fascism he said it tends to have these things one it's a cult of tradition so the way things used to be it's a rejection of modernism that there's a problem in our society we need to make things better again um we need to have um action for action's sake so the idea of doing things because it's important to do so um this agreement is a form of treason so your treasonous to the the commitment to the idea this is very similar to Communism too with the Fidelity to the dictatorship of the proletariat if you um were pursuing something that wasn't what was agreed you're a class Trader that's how you know the some of the first Photoshop erasures were stolen having to photoshop out all the people he killed because they were class Traders right it's a way to to say that treason is is um uh Linked In disagreement with ideas fear of difference um so this is just any type of difference can be utilized at any time this goes back though to the ideology and the securitization where you can pick something and say it's the problem and then 10 minutes later say well that's not the problem anymore we do this over and over and over again it's persistent issue in the absence of political policies we get this emerging in political processes where we'll say that this is this thing this is the real ill this is the real problem and then 10 minutes later forget all about it right um uh appeal to social frustration okay obsession with a plot yes so there's an idea that someone's plotting against you there's always you know it's this person trying to do this or it's this group is behind I'm not using good examples here because I honestly don't want to platform fascism so I'm not going to do it right um and so the enemy is both strong and weak this is I think I have this one schroederer's immigrant right um where is it here schroederer's immigrant simultaneously stealing your job and too lazy to work right it it doesn't work both way like it's it's there right both strong and weak at the same time um pacifism is trafficking With the Enemy so like if you don't believe in militarism and let's be clear this is linked to nationalism because nationalism is a ideological coherence to the National Security of the State National Security and that security then justifies us going to war and fighting people and doing you know the rest of that and the idea of Traders comes out of the idea that you wouldn't want to go to war um so this has always been the the Rand Paul version of libertarianism in the U.S they've been largely against Foreign Wars and intervention um because they say they're not implicated in it now we we don't need to unpack that too much but it is framed as as weak as weakness to to do this um and so we have contempt for the week because they aren't strength because we're we're valorizing strength or the idea of a strong unified body right there's a lot of weird kind of bodily politics it's very modernist um especially Nazi uh Germany was very much about this kind of German modernism that this is the highest element remember Heidegger the the political theorists or the philosopher uh was was a proponent Advocate was implicated fully thoroughly in the Nazi party they believed that this was this is the end of kind of high modern ideology was that high modern ideology produced the showa the Holocaust um the the massive eradication of a majority of the Jewish population across Europe of which many of those States participated because they were anti-semitic as well I'll get into that maybe later I will get into that I think in two weeks of anti-Semitism so we'll bring it in back there but then frame does this and so everybody is educated in heroism heroism and masculinity and militarism are strongly linked together and so there's always the danger um I've just been doing some research recently on kind of the heroic masculinity and this idea of you know 300 right this idea of heroic masculinity as being like this nostalgic longing for the way in which men were men in the past right these weird machismos right and obsession with weapons and weaponry of being the strongest with the best tools uh selective populism and fascism new speak you know I'm sure that this these radical this will go away but this is the woke mind virus of the moment right um so fascism did not disappear it did not only emerge and disappear post-world War II um you know Spain under Franco they argue that Rwanda Jenner said I think it's a little more complicated I get it it it's kind of fascists but it really was I don't know if this is we'll get into how we view ethnic conflict later in the course but the idea here is that that ethnic conflict I mean I've always argued can you see World War II as an ethnic conflict right was it was it a competing set of cultural ideals that we're fighting against one another and against minorities so remember the the Kurds and the Roma or sorry the Roma and um the lgbtq communities and as well as those differently abled were all in the camps as well um they were all um part targeted as being um denigrating the social whole right as not being strong or this and so there is still um I just right-wing I'm sorry like if the leftist has to take the communist and socialist I think the right-wing parties have to take the fascists with them it seems only fair I don't know me being a liberal um and so this idea of Europe and North America having these I don't know if we call them resurgent I think they've always been there they're being platformed right and let's not look too far as to which platforms Amman one are platforming these things um and so this idea of of white pride and stuff like that anti-immigration anti-aroma attitudes are alive and well they've never persisted and that they've they've always persisted they've never abated in Europe um the European Court of human rights has made it clear that their disappearance is deaths marginalization exclusion lack of access to resources and persistent prosecution and Disappearance in Europe to Roma has started prior to these fascist parties and continues to the present so let's not think that nationalism doesn't continue to do those things um we can do this now there I don't believe in the corporatist thing here this is just the video I found I think it's okay we will find out I'm not 100 on this if I platform something yeah we will unpack it I assume if it's on YouTube no I can't make that I just argue the opposite we'll see I I'm just talking about the relationship between corporatism and fascism because there isn't any analysis of this in the text and so it doesn't really have a coherent understanding but in a series of corporatism class conflict will only make the country and economy unstable and inefficient so this is why fascism and the fascists and Communists have always fought literally street right I've been at protests where they've literally fought um the Communists believe that they cannot because of the dictatorship the proletariat stuff there is no reasonable debate with fascism they just have to destroy them um that's it's the punch of fascist stuff that was happening um with the rise of the right the old right the rise of the right in the U.S um because they have fundamentally different views the coherent social body is one that says that as all Canadians we need to be Canadians together it's a form of nationalism which then says class conflict is divisive um the class conflict Marxist crowd say this stuff is um trying to eradicate is in the defense of the rulers um and that it's not materially going to benefit everybody and so they they just fight they literally fight because they both believe um that their positions are okay in advocating violence um the liberals do not as these classes struggle for power over the other corporatism believes that in order for an economy to be stable there needs to be Harmony among the working classes with all three working together in order to ensure prosperity for their Nation okay so economy to be stable this goes back to the capitalist argument and this is why it's so important to do capitalism first so capitalism distinguishes the economy from politics from society from culture and says it's something distinct and then it becomes something we obsess over is there enough GDP growth are we moving fast enough are we developing properly as if that's distinct from the social and political context in which it comes and then it becomes especially in a nationalist framework a thing that we have to defend you can't do that because it'll wreck the economy don't protest it'll wreck the economy don't argue for that it'll wreck the economy don't do these things it'll wreck the economy and make us unattractive investment destination they're all bound up together because they're all advocating for specific ways of viewing how we should understand our relationship to one another let's say for example you have construction workers and Architects The Architects make sure to lay out the plans on how a building should be constructed and the construction workers are the ones who build the building and the four men supervised work if there is conflict between these groups the building will certainly never be able to be built or at least will take much longer so this is a good example of how nationalism is supposed to smooth over all the conflict in society coherent social body right now the problem of course is you're like but I'm not getting paid as much as that architect or that foreman well you're a class you're a traitor to our cause and then you can be the one who literally is jailed or imprisoned remember Antonio gramsci that that framework from earlier when we talked about hegemony he was in prison under the fascist regime in Italy and those are his prison notebooks that we have because he was arguing this stuff he was imprisoned for arguing for class conflict over National coherence without the Architects the construction workers will not know the layouts and how to build while The Architects despite having the blueprints can never build the building on their own it is only when both the groups learn and realize that they are both dependent on each other and choose to coop operate can the construction project be realized the same so back to Aristotle and the division of labor here the division of labor is seen as natural right natural is used all the time that it's naturally to divide Us in division of labor and anything that disrupts that natural body is seen as a virus an invasion of something that has to be purged or eradicated same exact way organs cooperate and work together in order to keep the body healthy so this is a classic kind of fascist corporatist idea that there's a coherent body that works in a certain way that is uniform and that doesn't for example have an accident where I don't have part of that body no that would be a deviant body that's not the idealized body so they idealize the social whole of the nation and then see remember we only have 192 nation states in 7 000 languages those languages are going to be seen as threats to the coherence of that social body and this is the core pillar of corporatism choosing to promote class cooperation rather than class conflict where all three classes realized that they need the other classes in order to function properly and efficiently unlike class conflict where the working classes are engaged in a constant power struggle corporatism seeks to end class conflict once and for all and bring heart oh see that's the part where we should all when everybody whenever someone has a final solution run just run run someone's dying absolutely someone's dying it once and for all is it the only way to establish once and for all is the death penalty that's otherwise you get appeals at least listen liberal democracy has its problems but the appeal process is one that I am absolutely advocating for Harmony and prosperity to all three working classes just as in socialism and capitalism corporatism as well has its own sub units with varying beliefs but in the end they all follow the basic and core pillars of the corporatist economic system a lot of these corporate subunits emerged long before the rise of extreme right-wing and fascist States in Europe the idea of liberal corporatism emerged during the 19th century in the United States yes the New Deal the the you know the green New Deal the New Deal was a corporatist model it absolutely was and has been attributed to English liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill according to his ideas of liberal corporatism the state should not completely disregard the idea of capitalism but rather have the higher working class focus more on recognizing the needs of their employees rather than focus on making large profits off their backs uh off their backs probably wasn't in Mill um but the idea of of having social benefit and limiting social harm does does come in there there was this always this concept of no blush no no bless oblige the idea of the the rich being obligated to help the poor um this is one of the dangers of capitalism right it was that the the old premise like the the knights um there was the knights honor in the classic system there was the idea that the Monarch was um was at least some level obligated to their subjects when you turn everything into Market relations then the market is has no obligation to anybody we'll get into that with with uh anti-homeless architecture in a bit and then of course you have fascist corporatism the vast majority of fascist regimes in the 20th century used corporatism as their main economic system most notably the Kingdom of Italy which was the first fascist to adopt corporatism however the you know for everything else he made the trains run on time right that was the argument that was always was made with Mussolini that he fixed the economic problems and then that justified all the other main difference between fascist corporatism and the original idea of corporatism is that the state would incorporate every single corporate interest in the early 20th century corporatism was mainly practiced and promoted why am I being seduced by some Italian music in the background my Catholics as I mentioned previously the idea of corporatism emerged under the pope and it was an attempt to integrate Catholic Social teachings into the modern industrialized Society this is why the vast majority of State Catholic Nations across the world had corporatism as their economic system even after the post-world war II reconstruction period there were attempts to bring back corporatism in order to combat liberal capitalism this was supported by Christian democrats National conservatives and even a few social Democrats well and you understand why right because this creates a the idea of a social obligation um there was this it there was a history in in Canada of a red Tory tradition instead of blue tours right so red Tories have this kind of British sense of of republicanism that says that we are obligated to help Canadians all benefit together um and the idea of the liberal capitalism is coming under critique specifically from these types of Frameworks is that the liberal capital is everything's a market relation and there's no nationalism in here I mean diefenbaker did some of this stuff different Baker's the winner instituted the kind of Bill of Rights in Canada because he saw it as a kind of an obligation of Canadians to help one another so it was a form of conservatism that said that uh nationalism and conservatism go together to help each other um it just yeah we and so it's easier to find an external enemy it's easier to securitize than it is to to find the idea that we should all contribute more to help those who are the less fortunate EO corporatism came to be and was most prominent in the 60s and 70s there were numerous attempts to bring corporatism to the United States in order to replace the capitalist model yeah okay no um a a problem with YouTube is you can't check the sources and so without the sources like you can say John Stuart Mill but show me where and what are the sources I don't really um think that that's useful so corporatism then is the arrangement of society and organizations that directly interact with the state so this can be the the tripart type bargaining that's what the international labor organization was based on um the capitalists the government the politicians and the laborers all get together they meet at a table and they debate things that's why uh unifor or the Canadian Auto Workers still has such a significant role in Canadian Society was that traditionally it was seen as the kind of the the the spear point of the labor mobilization in Canada and so it would coordinate what it coordinated then kind of trickled down to the rest of Canada because it set the standards right um this is all over the place so the Islam Association of uh China their Japan Inc religious associations lobbying groups it's not necessarily about corporations it's about corporatism as a a coherent body a corpus right think of it more like that and so it does come from the Pope in 1891 on this idea of capital labor the pope was worried that the marxists were fomenting all of this uh strife and that and specifically the the Communists were anti-religious right um you know religion's the opioid of the masses was Mark said so the idea then was in order to make both um Catholicism relevant and respond to Marxism we came up with this idea that that we need to have social justice that social justice was ensuring class Harmony it's wild now to think about social justice Warriors but this comes from the pope specifically in a kind of Quasi somewhat fascist move saying that we need to have social harmony right that we have to have Market forces that liberal capitalism tempered by moral considerations that we have to have things like the idea of a living wage that unionization is good so that we don't have class conflict that property needs to be protected that communism is uh terrible but so is unrestrained capitalism right um and so that I think that is our the current pope has been pretty critical of of kind of billionaires in capitalism and this idea that God is on the side of the poor which I mean we text that's what it's there and so we have a bunch of these and this goes back to the the state capitalist model um the Asian model uses this strong central government's large support for corporations um forms of of chosen Union so legal and illegal unions um the exclusion of non-approved unions why because a lot of the unions will radicalize or argue for positions outside of the social good what is conceived of by the center right um directed development strategies so you can Target a region for development potash development in Canada um uh the development of the uh the tar Sands the bitumen um a development of that as a regional strategy um as something that the federal government should support you know in that case it's been a long contentious process between Alberta and the federal government which I don't have time to get into but the idea here is that the government supports certain businesses it was the meaty system in um in Japan Sony Honda were all part of developing what became the consumer goods that were shipped to the U.S and those brands are still very important today because they had State support in the ways in which they did this now we have the the both the Asian model and then we have the Russian model of corporatism by default which is the transition from the Soviet system into our system resulting these massive oligopolies right these huge um conglomerates of businesses that came about through this weird kind of government directed well you know this business you get to bid on it first and now you're a billionaire overnight because we've taken something that was socialized before and we've put it in private hands and so if you have resources or the capacity to control those resources you automatically get these huge amounts of money and they still you know you can call this kleptocracy or whatever it's the idea that specific key figures and specific key businesses are then closely linked to the regime and that regime is closely linked to them and so we've got all you know the with the Chelsea owner and we've got all of these these questions that have come out from the sanctions on Russia have targeted these specific Industries and these specific individuals which has been happening well before the Ukrainian Invasion um that the foreign interference in U.S elections and the failure to comport themselves has resulted in sanctions on specific individuals because so much of what's happening in the Russian corporatist model is those individuals and firms are closely allied with the interests and they have Banks well quasi-state monopolies and cabinet members on corporate boards so business politicians and bureaucrats are heavily connected and then the Italian fascist corporatism of the that era was about the single coordinated entity the you know the coordination of Labor and corporate production the nationalization of property the dissolving of independent uh labor unions and National syndicalism so we have one designated Union you must be a member of you can't have a wildcat strike right corporate control over sections of the economy and the rejection of uncontrolled markets and the calls for Full Employment and so we have these Frameworks I'll get into I think these are kind of a combination of the stuff we've talked about all along as Modi and Trump talking about populism we'll talk about populism in the next video that borrow from elements of those other things Charisma for one which which overlaps um with the obsession with the cult of personality as another one which is is a bit of of this the stalinist tradition a bit of these kind of fascist undertones um or corporatist undertones if you want to be a more sympathetic reading but that's why I think it is important to bring in corporatism because it's largely absent from the text
