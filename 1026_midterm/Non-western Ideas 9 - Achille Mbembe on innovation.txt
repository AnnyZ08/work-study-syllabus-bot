 okay so we'll deal with uh Sheila membe and this idea of the ways in which we can think about these multiple modernities when we bring in specific experiences outside of the West the non-west and experimentation this is the case because many at least in South African rest of the continent feel that our encounters with the world can no longer be explained by Orthodox thinking um many believe that conditions compel us to experiment with different images of thought and to create hopefully new Concepts that will help us imagine a different existence in common that dear the question of the university and the question of knowledge is has to do with the possibility the political possibility of imagining a different existence in common that is what is at stake and even when we look around us what strikes me the most is the emergence of new bodies of thought the formation of new knowledge assemblages and the extent to which most of these assemblages are pretty much in Rapture with with or are creatively building on the old disciplinary demarcations so typical of a modern universities now part of what characterizes these new bodies of thought or assemblages is the extent to which they are involved in rethinking almost everything on the nature of knowledge itself the nature of being the nature of matter new conceptions of time in particular deep time or in any case the geological recasting of historical time that has been precipitated by among others the the anthropocene questions about the ways in which the human world should be reimagined culturally and politically in terms of its relation with the Earth or debates about the uh the end of The Human Condition as marked by by agency why are the questions in any case concerning the relation of human life to planetary life I could go on and on but all of these issues are the subject of a renewed discussion in a whole variety of platforms most of which are not contained by the university as an institution there's a huge reservoir of knowledge outside of University Institution uh uh which which is there and some of the most exciting experiments in the humanities are actually going on at the interface of what we produce in the university and what is going on outside of our worlds so the couple things I would say there um absolutely right I 100 agree the weird part for me especially in the on the back of crypto is these Innovation hubs that the university tries to develop and where it looks towards the private sector as a way to develop innovative ideas normally by like wiping the Slate clean rather than looking at the ways in which history contexts experience different ways of doing this have been a conceptualized outside of capitalism and the Western Academy and so little of this happens we're getting a bit of it but here he's highlighting something that's really interesting in the west is that we've had the kind of persistent defunding of humanities as a kind of a you know an effort the need to rethink kind of practical efforts and ideas about how we can innovate rather than thinking about those spaces as ways in which they can conceptualize better life worlds because they look at context history and experience in order to develop these ideas and so what we're looking at here I mean is this idea of alter alternate or multiple modernities that don't see everything as breaks or revolutionary innovations that don't draw on previous knowledge and experience because I mean there's a couple ways in which you can do that private property requires you to make a univocal claim over that territory so looking at the market as source of innovation as well way to say oh nobody thought of this until me my Innovation is something that I can then use in our system in order to extract resources from that's that's patent trolls right patent trolls famously like Blackberry um when it went under or kind of Quasi went under it sold all of its patents it had thousands of patents right um Apple's new um uh uh virtual whatever you call it goggles or whatever has something like 5000 patents in it so Innovation is also about the ability to claim a rupture with the past and so modernity Western modernity that which is modern is generally framed as as distinct from that which is in the past and therefore it's based on opposites or binary simplifications emancipation colonialism human rights genocide democracy dictatorship and so we want to think about the universal as that which doesn't have any relationship to the contingent but it's always being made through contingent claims and so the only way to understand a contingent claim is to situated in history and context and so the idea of modernity is is built on this constant breaking with traditions in order to be able to claim those Traditions as distinct but is not reading those those history and those traditions in terms of political ideas and thought which is what we'll do in the next videos
