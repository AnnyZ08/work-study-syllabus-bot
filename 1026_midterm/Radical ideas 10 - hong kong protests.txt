 all right so we will finish off with this video so this is in the online version of the chapter uh I don't know how relevant it is to what we're talking about but let's let's give it a shot the Hong Kong government says a bill passed by the U.S Senate supporting anti-government demonstrators is unnecessary and unwarranted lawmakers unanimously passed the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act on Tuesday it would require Washington to assess Hong Kong's status as a U.S trading partner each year as well as impose sanctions and other penalties against those who are undermining the city's autonomy the vote came as protests in Hong Kong have become increasingly more violent most recently protesters armed with bows and arrows and gasoline bombs have squared off against police at Hong Kong Polytechnic University China also condemned the Senate vote saying it plans to retaliate if the bill becomes law the bill will now go to the house which approved its own version of the measure in October the two Chambers will need to come to some sort of consensus before any legislation can be sent to president Trump the White House has not indicated if the president plans to sign the bill if it makes it to his desk the Senate also passed a bill Banning exports of certain items for the Hong Kong police including rubber bullets stun guns and pepper spray okay sure um so what's the radical part there that you're giving you're not giving guns to the police that the people are fighting with the police that it's China's efforts to undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong I don't understand that example it's a weird example I guess I've written about the umbrella movement I guess the Hong Kong umbrella movement could be characterized as radical is it that we don't know maybe that's example that we don't know that we would describe it as a radical political ideology that offends their autonomy versus Chinese I don't have a ton of answers for that um I think we covered all of those questions um
