 so it is weird in that chapter I was just thinking back it's weird in the chapter on the this isms that we don't have anti-Semitism uh which I think is a persistent and Perpetual problem of the western nation-state system in perpetuity in part because the nation state always assumes a single nation and state and these nationalists Fear The Insider who looks like them right um and so it's always been a i i we can get into this in more detail anti-Semitism is a key part of the modern nation-state system that's just a full stop that's not that there are other other isn't other isms as well and so we have settler colonialism which we've talked about we have islamophobia which we'll talk quite a bit about next class we have all sorts of other isms that don't come in here I guess because they aren't a coherent political ideology but if you look at the rise of hate crimes with the rise of the right I mean the top of the list is persistent anti-Semitism in these contexts so it's weird that it's absent I would just say that um anarchism also has a problem with anti-Semitism too um but um again I'm assuming this will come back when we start dealing with identity categories but I do think it's an ism as well all right so idea remember ideologies arise during social disruptions and deeply polarized societies so in types of political contestation we have both anarchism populism as examples as well here um so anarchism okay inspired by movements on the left and right again okay um I don't know what that means but like what does a monarchist Anarchist sure whatever um and a rejection of hierarchical forms of governance sure I will say that they have two I I put three in here um because I'm influenced I would say by the one which is just the anthropological analysis of bodies that refuse Authority right and find it interesting right doesn't mean that many anarchists it just means I find it interesting and we should probably talk about it um so three distinct categories social collectivist anarchism individual anarchism historical anarchism like all the other categories which I'm okay with with fascism but probably not communism we don't have any good examples here um we we don't really talk about the ways in which these systems are organized we just talk about them as non-organized so occupy for example had hand signals I've tried to use them in class every once in a while I agree don't agree oppose block point of order clarify direct response want to talk so it was uh in occupy occupy had a radically non-hierarchical structure during the Occupy movements and this was the way that they would organize discussion so in Liberal Democratic discussion we have Robert's Rules of Order um there it's a book you can just download it on how to run meetings so what I used to be the parent Council chair at my local public school when my daughter was there I was the chair we'd follow Roberts early's order when I am in a department meeting we follow Robert's Rules of Order it's the rules of order that have occupied so this was an easier way for non-hierarchical organizations to organize themselves because they don't really have chairs and things like that there's a hierarchical order in Robert's Rule of Order there's ways to exploit it to in order to make sure that people talk or don't talk right that's the benefit of it okay so anarchism in the Socialist collectivist framework admit properties theft and so this is why they're trying to make the link here between this and libertarianism so it kind of far right stuff I'll come back to that again when we talk about um the technocratic forms of this the creation of worker syndicates so this is a narcosyndicalism so a narcocenticalism instead of having like a top-down labor union it's like a mutually created form of syndicalism that allows kind of for more freedom and movement um you know Chomsky is a kind of public advocate of anarchism and Anarchist critique he would be a kind of a kind of I guess a weak social Anarchist I guess he would call it himself um he's his book manufacturing consent um just talks about the ways in which the mass media reinforces the hierarchy and authority of existing systems he famously looks at um during the East Timor crisis the ways in which the New York Times just supported the American positions against data and evidence so it said it was ideological right so it does this here's a little bit of Chomsky talking about those things um crucially Anarchist action well I think a sensible approach can start with remarks by the perceptive important Anarchist intellectual act and also activist Rudolph rocker I'll quote him he saw anarchism not as a fixed self-enclosed social system with a fixed answer to all the multifarious questions and problems of human life but rather as a definite Trend in the historic development of mankind which strives for the free unhindered unfolding of all the individual and social forces in life from the 1930s these concepts are not really original they derive from the Enlightenment and the early Romantic Period in rather similar words one of the founders of Classical liberalism among many other achievements describe the leading principle of his thought as the absolute and essential importance of human development in its richest diversity that's a phrase that John Stuart Mill took as the epigraph to his on Liberty it's interesting that everybody's referencing Mill right so that is to say that that we have to go through these liberal that there's abounding to liberalism and capitalism and thinking about these things in all the other approaches because we're always engaging with them that's the relevance of the Canon right it follows from that that institutions that constrain such human development are illegitimate unless of course they can somehow justify themselves you find a similar conception widely an Enlightenment thought so for example in Adam Smith everyone has read the opening paragraphs of Wealth of Nations where he extols the wonders of the vision of labor but not many people have gotten farther inside to read his bitter condemnation of division of labor and insistence that in any civilized society the government will have to intervene to prevent it because it will destroy personal integrity and essential human rights will turn people he said into creatures as stupid and ignorant as a human can be it's not too easy to find that passage whatever the reason may be if you look in the scholar standard scholarly Edition the University of Chicago by Bicentennial Edition it's not even listed in the index well but it's one of the most important passages in the book uh looked at in these terms anarchism is a tendency in human development that seeks to identify structures of hierarchy domination Authority uh and others that constrain human development and then it seeks to subject them to a very reasonable challenge justifiers so that's very Enlightenment right and very liberal to say okay what are the reasonable foundations for your claims because often forms a hierarchy and Authority don't ever re-establish their Foundation right like this chapter doesn't make it clear what its perspective is when it's talking so I'll let them finish and then we'll move on I don't want too much self demonstrate that you're legitimate and maybe in some special circumstances or conceivably in principle and if you can't meet that that challenge which is the usual case the structure should be dismantled and it's Nathan rightly adds not just dismantled but reconstructed From Below uh the okay we we get it so it's like this idea of of doing it so there's all of these ideas bound up in them anti-authorianism collectivism direct action internationalism anti-nationalism and anti-marxism in particular because they see those Frameworks or the the demand for State intervention and then the withering of the state so State intervention under socialism withering of the State under Marxism um to be um still the use of the state so they're against that contemporary examples there's forms of anti-fascist movements in the Black Block um I've been seeing a lot of black block protesters uh um in my day um and so they all you know um all anarchists well this is some anarchists Askew violence I don't know again there's a subsession with violence the black Block's been implicated in violence lots of lots of fascist anti-fascist and Anarchist movements have been implicated in violence They Don't Really Care um but you know for Chomsky his key thing is that the truth should we should speak truth to power this is very Aristotelian or platonic and we'll get to that in a minute um utopianism in practice um there's a whole book on this I mean if there's a Chapo trap house uh um episode on this about how this libertarian Utopia established in um didn't have the infrastructure in place um to deal with the types of things that collectively we pull resources to prevent um and so we have that that social Collective of anarchism we have the individualist anarchism which is very much this kind of libertarianism right um this this type of this rejection of the legitimacy of government the maximization of individual freedom from government control for me the easiest example is the crypto Libertarians um if you look at Nakamoto who created bitcoin he embedded in the first social block of quite a paper written on this um that Bitcoin was an explicit response to the bank bailouts so their idea was is that we can't trust the government anymore let's build our own money um and so largely about this idea of indiv in the crypto libertarian vision individual liberty privacy and encryption so encryption so the state shouldn't have the right to to view your stuff decentralization monetary Freedom cyber Funk ideals which I it should be aged in there I think but um we don't have to get into that too much voluntary interactions and contracts that's what ethereum is based it's a cryptocurrency that allows you to do contracts that are mutually framed so you don't need outside state to to authorize your contracts technological innovation and disruption right so about disrupting forms of Oppression right they see that now the problem with that framework is that you get this is famously Mark Zuckerberg with the motto that he should move fast and break things what are those being you know democracy um that this is one of the things that he could break by platforming all sorts of myths and disinformation right um and so uh the other one like these innovators come in with these technological Anarchist ideas of how individuals can be freed through the lack of State control um you know government or Google sidewalk Labs was this fantastic project that was going to develop in downtown Toronto there's a ton written on it um that basically was this libertarian vision of everything being done through Google's networks and and everything could be paid for wirelessly and we could just we could live in this place except Google wanted to control all the data because that's freedom from government intervention right um the problem of course was that part of the territory they wanted was church territory and good luck getting churches off their territory and this is what happened to the great Innovative sidewalk Labs it's now a Budget rent a car that's the only building that's left and that's what what came of it so anarchism as a way of challenging Authority makes a ton of sense as a way of organizing new spaces has a degree of fallibility which um can't be overstated that said too there are lots of anarchist communities that organize themselves and States see them as a threat to their Monopoly on the use of force and crush them mercilessly so it's not always on their side it's that like this is the problem with open systems all of these different systems are interacting with one another which creates all sorts of deviations from their utopianism right like the the Liberal Liberal capitalism has to respond to the idea that Communists has taken all these peasants and making them middle class workers right and so this becomes a challenge to the legitimacy of your ideal system when somebody else can can develop their alternatives to it and so in creating this coherent ideological space there's this obsession with the idea of freedom but then the freedom devolves into things that that people don't seem to want um and that these Anarchist Vision I mean Twitter is acquisition right that this idea of creating a free speech platform okay but if you want to maintain that platform you have to make sure this is zuboff talks about this in her book on surveillance capitalism she said one of the problems of YouTube in particular was that it would uh platform anti-Semitism next to a product or service and you could screen cap that and then send it to tide and say why are is is your product next to anti-semitic hate and if they want to maintain the business they have to make the businesses happy and in order to do that you run into this problem that freedom is gonna true freedom is going to produce all sorts of stuff that as a society as any group is going to want social regulation just a bear crash this level because they don't want their product associated with that and so this has been the Perpetual problem of creating an idea a coherent ideological space for these kind of these crypto utopians is that they can certainly platform stuff they can certainly mobilize certain amounts of the population we just don't think it's a majority of the population right and so this this kind of Perpetual problem of these now we'll come back to this with with populism
