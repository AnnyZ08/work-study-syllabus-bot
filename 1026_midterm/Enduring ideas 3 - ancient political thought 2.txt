 so coming back to Aristotle then um you know Aristotle as as Plato's student and this author of politics saw the policies the highest form of human Association um the setting in which we could pursue a good life that um humans as political animals are allowed to um the policy allows people to to reach its fullest potential the sympathetic reading is that um he is doing this because he's articulating a vision of the world that he wants to see a cynical reading would be that he's articulating a vision of the world for the citizens who want him to do so I don't know I don't know what kind of education would be if you paid for the ideas so if you only got ideas that you paid for or you chose would it be education or would it be a kind of dunning-kruger effect where dunning-kruger is those without information tend to overestimate um the the their ability to make decisions up based on their information it's a a theory of of ignorance right those who are ignorant are ignorant to their ignorance um and so I don't know um whether or not Aristotle was teaching because he cynically believed he cynically was just teaching the citizens what they wanted or he actually believed these ideas I don't know how you'd ever determine that and so the idea here is that the goal of the police is to create virtue and frenesis this idea of practical Judgment of experience those with the time to contemplate and think about good decision making should be able to do so but the question becomes who picks those people or how are they picked is it the social division of labor do we need to have buy-in from the people who aren't doing that um you know the idea of the rule by the many the tyranny of the majority the tyranny of the crowd thinking about those things but of course we you have the the exclusion of slaves and women from citizenship so this is back to that Chilean text part of what he does there is talk about Aristotle Aristotle was born into a colonial world one where you know Athens and you know had all these assumptions that the per between uh Athens and Persia all the assumptions about who was barbarians and what were the threat to the society you know the macedonians are threatening them that this colonial world of inter-imperial uh competition was a constant underlying assumption about what the polis was and so Aristotle as I mentioned last week was an immigrant slash permanent alien permanent resident and so we can think about this to what extent we are in the very same framework they were then because the clear articulation of this is which system is best we are still having these debates um about which system is best and so if we had to choose between the Chinese system which has allowed 800 million people to move from poverty to middle class them in the quickest fastest way in human history that is a form of success we've never seen before um it allows them to be consumers now it comes at the expense of their political autonomy and the autonomy of their ideas um but I mean we could say that the Western American ideal is also coming under attack it allows Freedom it allows Commerce but it also turns everything into Commerce and that freedom is also a lack of access to public goods right because you can't afford them or because they're not provided or because they're being provided privately and you don't have any money and then there's a Russian system which has a strong sense of authority and that there's certainly the capacity for those in positions of power to do better and articulate a vision of the world that is opposed to this Chinese and American Vision but we don't know if it's it's better and so these this idea of Aristotle just coming up with an abstract political idea is also kind of him articulating that idea like there I could do a very sympathetic reading to well I don't know how sympathetic it can be which is probably my own biases to the current Russian model let's let's be clear but the let's say prior well I was going to say prior to the Ukrainian Vision but I can't do that either uh let's just say there there are ways to articulate this it's called the splinternet right the different ways on the internet where we have three different worlds one that is heavily tightly controlled one that is anarchical and challenging Authority and one that is based on Commerce right I don't have a claim as to which system is best I have my personal biases as to which are best but whatever system I'm living in I'm probably gonna have a bias towards it right so Aristotle absolutely is articulating these claims about the polis and this idea of public good being the best way to do things but he's doing it kind of like I'm doing it yeah it might be the best and so the idea of Pericles conferring citizenship only to the children of two etherian parents meant that you know even back then the polis is for those people who are already there at the expense of those who don't have two parents right this is this is blood Quantum stuff but we still do many citizenship systems are still based on do you have blood in you which is by no means Democratic or fair right um and so Aristotle as I mentioned is a medic he's a free worker but he couldn't own land he couldn't vote in the assembly couldn't serve as a magistrate and couldn't represent themselves in court and one-third to one half of the free population in Athens was Medics which means that the bulk of the population that we are talking about we're talking about the city and the polis and the ideal and the participation of the public good is public good for those who are are capable of doing so and this is I mean the question classic question of interloping especially for for students right this has long been the case that we know that the brodale and all the the the hoco stuff at Western has been an object of um scrutiny by those who are in London for long and they can pass laws that are punitive to those that have parties we can give you a 500 fine if people are drinking in front of your house that type of stuff so it perversely incentivizes students who are interloping who absolutely contribute to the economy who are in for a short period of time to vote in Municipal elections and to come out enforcement Municipal elections to make sure that their interests are reflected and so this becomes this question about where are you from right and how long do you need to be somewhere until you are capable of articulating political decisions and authority and you know do communities take advantage of for example students because they're there temporarily and they're in this interstitial this kind of this temporary status means that they don't feel a sense of obligation to the community the Western bubble is a real thing just in terms of geography right you've got a river running around the campus and it makes it hard to get in and out and so that that disconnects the University from the rest of the City versus you know lots of campuses that are downtown core of a big urban center right or multiple campuses and so they're competing campuses so there there's this notion that those who have the right to have political decision making should be should be fixed in some way but it's not clear what's the best way to do that and so this idea um is that Aristotle often referred to Athenians as they instead of us um he was a sympathizer to Macedonia and so he's forced to leave um he had this to settle in in lesbos and he returned only to teach Alexander the Great and so his visits framed how he thought about politics and about the public good and then you know this idea of of to what extent is he actually engaged in this political space or is he talking about the political space of others right he is teaching those who are in power but he's not in power himself and can you articulate a vision of power if you don't get to participate in it I don't um and so this is the absent context we have practices that are very similar today States making laws that that allow migrants to be second-class citizens xenophobia is rampant what system is best is rampant though if you sympathize with the wrong system you can be perceived as as a traitor or somehow that your your ideas are are non-sympathetic I think I would have questions if I was a strong supporter of of Russia or China in the North American context I I think everyone would have questions about what am I articulating and should I be able to articulate those ideas to people who are supposed to be learning right and so the question becomes if those ideas are suspect are Aristotle's idea suspect and and and what are we trying to to produce when we're producing these political ideas are we interested in stability for the state are we interested in stability for leaders are we interested in actually educating us to think about politics and so if if he is if Aristotle is sympathetic to the macedonians is he too Macedonian to teach us properly and so the idea here is that you know this this Treatise is a politics about an asylum Seeker between Imperial powers that he lacked the rights of a settled native Citizen and so maybe we should be suspect or maybe we shouldn't treat any ideas as a suspect we should treat the ideas on their face right I don't know and so the idea here is that there is a tragedy built into the Greek model that Sophocles in Antigone is about being in a corrupt system or a system that's not yours and having to make choices and so antigones often held up as the the classic ethical choice not allowed to because they were Traders bury their your family and that the Fidelity to your family is more important than Fidelity to this state so Antigone breaks the laws in order to bury her family because she believes ethics is more important than morals and these are about this relationship of the individual to Collective good um you know Plato's apology and Credo and okay I just had to put this in here because I did voice to speech on this and Plato when I say Plato my voice to speech made it Plato which is to say that the con commercialization of all of our tools actually impedes our ability to think so I like the idea of there's here's one of the dangers of our model that is based around incentives is that words that are most common or are literally trademarked Plato is first referenced with uh in in Microsoft word's voice to speech is first referenced with the toy that you get to make and play which again you could make at home but we we can consume and buy in Brandon Market versus the classic political thinker um and so Plato was accused of him priority and corrupting the youth right as as these educators are the education is seen as corrupting the youth because it's not building good compliance citizens or it's not telling us that those in power should be respected and honored and so this is the trial and Death of Socrates this is what the discussion is the the idea that he articulated unexamined life is not worth living which is to say that these there's these Notions of education is radical or even if we're teaching about the state we're teaching about ways to undermine the state and so this is the idea of you know the self-interrogation or thinking about what we are what our assumptions are and how we think about things is the foundation of what we should be doing here right and thinking uh during uh Dark Times versus the automatic bandwiding of action this virtue signaling solidarity this truth as the goal of politics so is the truth the truth the one that the state believes is important for everyone to have the leaders believe is important to have a compliant populace or is it the truth of fidelity that the individual has to the Earth being flat or whatever it is and so this idea you know about this it's in this text so we'll come back to it later but I mean de tocqueville argued this is that everyone was going to turn it he calls it like literal sheep sheeple like we're not even using new political Concepts and ideas so virtue signaling like we could argue that what What's Happening Here with Aristotle is virtue signaling like he's telling them what they want to hear and with Plato and with all of these others they're telling the leaders what they want to hear in order to maintain their status and position and when they start to in their elderly age start doing things that are more radical they get literally thrown to jail or executed and so the idea here is that you know we do these things all the time we articulate claims of social good through individual Choice all the time I am being moral I am being better I am doing the right thing versus the idea of just being self-interested but that moral better is a form of self-interest you are showing that you are superior and so we've got these questions about just basic things like that right like but this idea of in Canada the idea of banning plastic bags so we ban plastic bags to indicate that we are doing something good and it could very well be something good um the problem of course is that we'd have to measure that against some form of Truth so the truth could be we're pushing towards a system that is moving to more environmentally responsible ways of being okay fine so that's a articulation of a political goal that we share in common that is for the public good we could do it in a self-interested way businesses are fine with this because now they get to charge you for bags um and that the self-interest of this is that these retailers are still going to make money and that now they get to charge for something that in the past they had to pay for so they got no problems doing this um and then we could also frame it in terms of it is just virtual signaling because it doesn't if we shift to things like cotton bags they actually have a much higher impact on the environment than the other big I mean all of our system instructors have been based around Petro culture so of course it's going to be cheaper to use petrol based whatever but the idea here is that in terms of I think this is CO2 impact from the EPA on the BBC that a cotton bag if we're using that as the alternative it would have to be used hundreds of times to make up the difference of switching from one to the other so we could argue that it's it's actually not a social good it's just what's being informed to us is social good and it's ethical to not do that and so the individual is fighting against the ethics and so that's really what this ancient political thought is coming up it it's recurrent throughout these different thinkers and they come up with different ways of articulating it but there is a value in doing this because it's the same debates that they were having then or the same debates we're having now and so we can articulate that um as a as a way to understand these tensions that aren't going to go away
