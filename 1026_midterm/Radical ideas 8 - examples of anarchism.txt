 so this is the third edition um the anarchism the historical anarchism are giving a little more space um because it is less programmatic and more about kind of looking at the experiences of bodies that are resisting hierarchy and Authority we'll do that so the historical examination so this is particularly David Graber who just died during covid and James C Scott both were anthropologists both who are looking at the history of Anarchist action or efforts of actions that disrupt hierarchy and Authority which we they they label as you know Scott says he's got an anarchist squint and uh Graber sees himself as as an anarchist but you know kind of an anarchist interested in in events and ideas not interested in programmatic systems um so this idea of Anarchy is cooperation without hierarchy or state rule is less about what Chomsky is arguing and more at looking at in not in the liberal tradition or not in the history of those tradition but looking at the practices um and so this is largely against the idea of scientific or rational progress which is bound up in all of these these specifically in the the German and the Russian experience about how progress develops um you know the idea here is the state can play an emancipatory role only in some circumstances and that part of the problem here is that groups actually are really good at achieving social change but those social changes are inevitably co-opted so Graber uses in the shock of Victory he talks about how realistically like the everything came together in the 1970s to create this environmental movement that had a weird mixture of people that basically prohibited nuclear from our mindset and we've never been able to get it back and so like Canada is now pushing for small modular nuclear reactors there's still a lot of fear now it has to do with the Cold War and nuclear fallout and and all the the half-life of nuclear material is so long but it has created a success that he argues a success a shocking victory that we haven't quite recovered from and so this is another thing that that Graber talks about he just talking about the idea that people resist hierarchy and authority and some of the forms of hierarchy and Authority are just dumb um and this is jobs which I'm sure many of us have encountered so I made up a um Gmail account called do I have a BS job or what gmail.com and um I've been advertising on Twitter I've got like about 250 testimonies now and I have broken them down into five basic types there are flunky jobs which are basically people who just are there to make someone else look good um a lot of people sitting around office and say they basically don't do anything except like you know pass emails to someone and say no that's spam or you know they're just like there because if you don't have someone sitting at your desk you're not actually a real executive um similar to a receptionists that publishing companies where nobody ever calls you know they have to be there anyway okay so millions of flunky jobs like that um then you have what I call goons goons are people who are basically there to um you know you don't need them unless somebody else has them sort of like almost right if nobody had an army no it would need an army same as true corporate lawyers telemarketers all people like that so they often say ah this is a total there's no need for this um okay that's easy the next one is I called them duct tapers duct tapers are there are people who are there to fix a problem that does not need to exist and everybody knows it it'd be sort of like if you have a roof within the house instead of getting a roofer put a bucket down and hire someone to like empty the water every half hour a lot of Corporations do that um they'll hire someone just to deal with the damage or the fact that something is badly organized because it's easier than like fixing the problem so there's millions of those kind of people then there's box tickers box stickers are people who are there to allow an organization to say they're doing something that they're not doing um there's a lot of that in government but the corporations increasingly do that too so one person said I work at a care home my job is to like uh do interviews and collect data on what sort of entertainment people would like to have which I then tabulate and file you know and the problem with box stickers of course is that it takes up so much time that you could be be spending actually doing the thing he says like you know I could be entertaining these people but actually I've just been seven tenths of my time finding out what they would like to be doing for entertaining and then losing it because nobody cares um all right so that's a box ticker and then finally um taskmasters who are basically there basically middle management they're people who are there either to supervise people who don't need supervising which is most of middle management like people write to me all the time they say like I'm supposed to be making them work though you'd work all by themselves and you know I have to pretend I'm doing something so I make up these numbers and they do boxing exercises or something um and then um also make up new films there's a lot of people do have a job which is to make up new jokes yeah yeah there's a lot of people who basically so this this is what radical ideas are they expose something about the way in which we're doing things that's not just that we're challenging that Authority it's saying that it doesn't even make any sense and so to that that to me it appeals to me as as critical thinking right as critical critical Concepts right and so to have this chapter and not have any examples of the types of what Anarchist work looks like or what it it's actually interested in is so weird to me um and so this is in Scott's work so he's a kind of cons he's actually a conservative uh Anarchist a lot of realists um so um they kind of uh conservative nationalist theorists of American policy look at this stuff um because he's cynical about the nation state and so are they and so as a theory um he's using an anarchist squint which is to say it's not actually it isn't at all I'm just interested in the ways in which those isms produce problems um and so the anarchist squint is just saying uh bodies don't like these things um and so his first these are the Squints the supremacist he calls them premises he's not even making theories he's just straight here's an idea take it if you want right that's very Anarchist right um Modern Nation States have have been um far more that should be far more responsible for killing than has ever been conceived before it that the nation-state is the thing by which all of these are organized we can't talk about alternationalism without the nation state we can't talk about organization we can't talk about nationalism without the nation City and so that's what then justifies us mobilizing resources towards these ends it allows us to securitize things National Security because if we frame things in terms of actually the security of bodies it's fundamentally different and we might get to human security later in the course um and so this is bakunan this idea of freedom without socialism is is privileged and Injustice socialism about freedom of slavery and brutality just this idea that that it's bound up together um second that utopian scientism is not possible the Germans tried to plan forests they have a word for in German of forest death because you can't plan for us they have to have some level of kind of natural ecosystem relationships and you know Brazilians tried to design cities we've had lots of these cities I one this is I grew up near um this one Townsend um by the year 200 000 people in it why because Nanticoke had a whole bunch of manufacturing um uh stucco defasco Air Products um and so it became an industrial Hub and they assumed they designed they actually put the city hall here because they assumed that these this planned city would emerge because people would want to be close to where they worked people just drove so the city never happened so State planning top-down planning rarely works as Jane Jacobs you know you can design cities but people will make use of the Cities the way they do so good planning is desire paths there's sub desire paths where you let people move around and then you lay down the sidewalks because if you lay down the sidewalks people are going to go where they want to go you can put in fencing you can do all the rest that you see those paths all over campuses in particular where people actually walk and so if you actually design things for people and not for your planning model that's a more responsive way to do stuff the problem is is that most scientific planning or utopianism's top down and doesn't actually care about those types of things the ways in which people use spaces rather than their space is conceived right third huge disparities of wealth status and property make a mockery of Freedom so I just picked a couple of examples transplant tourism slum tourism and then anti-homeless architecture so I've got here um this Chinese man who sold the kidney to buy his iPhone okay those are anti-homeless spikes there's all sorts of this is a bench designed to not be comfortable for anyone so I don't know who it's for at the you know fully robotic coffee shop next to starving jobless homeless this idea then that this is a mockery of the idea of freedom so you can call it freedom but it's not actual Freedom if if it doesn't actually have your capacity to to be free and then the idea is that the final idea and why it's Anarchist is that organizations do not precipitate mobilization people mobilize and then we develop organizations to claim their mobilization as as ours so protest movements precipitate organizations which tame the protest and turn it in institutional channels um structural a change um you know largely occurs when there's massive non-institutionalized disruption in the forms of riots objection to tax on property unruly demonstrations theft arson and Defiance you can do this the Boston Tea Party you can do this over and over again this is this was in our first and second weeks it was the anti-slavery movements that people the slaves slave rebellions just always happen um and when they become more potent we have to come up with ways to to do it and so um why this is anarchist is that left-wing organizations see themselves as the Vanguard right that's what the Communist they're leninists they see themselves as needing leaders to lead the party so this is the iron law of oligarchy it's also the representative State structure it's also the monarchy the monarchy just assumes that subjects are theirs where subjects all the time are like screw this I'm gonna go with Robin Hood we're going to live in the forest um and so all of these things like workers write civil rights the Vietnam War welfare rights are seen as things that the state gave when in fact because the state is is the one who wants to co-opt responsibility when these are things that people just like screw this we're going to go out there and fight and do this stuff and so the when people are the most confrontational and least organized they are the least able to be co-opted by hierarchical structures they're the least hierarchical and so so if you don't have leaders to negotiate with and no one to bribe you can't corrupt the organization so this is the one I always use is that occupy Denver they refused they wanted to you know occupy protesters there the city governance says you have to elect a single representative official to speak for everybody and that goes against the non-hierarchical structure of occupy so um they put her up for leadership because she was a inspired it's a leaderless movement he said Shelby has more human traits than anyone she bleed breed and show emotion this is the opposite of the corporate world who chooses to do business let's make the same rule I have no idea how true this is but it's it's exemplifying this idea that the anarchist framework the anarchist experience is an interesting experience of bodies rebelling against hierarchical Authority it's anti-normative so to stick it in the isms fine do it but I don't think it's a good use of the examples that we have of the ways in which like the ways in which we structure Society are stupid and people are going to resist stupid and dumb things and that's kind of the the the addendum of anarchism that I that I wanted to put in here this kind of historical anarchism
