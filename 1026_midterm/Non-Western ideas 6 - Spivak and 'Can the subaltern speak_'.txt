 so thinking about thought provincializing thought is also about characterizing the ways in which hierarchy and superiority are are part of thought um we know this is the case I mean this is we've been talking about this from week one it political science is the study of the ruler and the ruler then is implicated in in forms of which this happens and you know that phenon is talking about the the colonies are in a kind of um marxian sense and a historical materialist sense let's frame it like that that the material conditions like that I used as the example three billion dollars a day going to oil the hierarchies and structures of of richness of of the capacity to do so don't come from nowhere right we have to set up these relations by which Saudi Arabia sends oil to the West Saudi Arabia gets the money the West gets the oil and those who are doing that are the ones who get the three billion dollars per day and so the reproduction of the transfer of wealth from regions to other regions is constantly reproducing hierarchies and those hierarchies then get equated with success right they've got more resources therefore you're successful um this is the kind of one of the weird geopolitics of the world is that by no fault of their own children are born somewhere on the planet and if that planet happens to have a lot of resources those resources then get framed As Natural as if it's part of them and so the the Trap here is that you know is as I mentioned earlier is the idea that Western philosophy traps African philosophy in a double bind either African philosophy is so similar to Western philosophy it doesn't make a a distinctive contribution so that it's it's separate from or it effectively is so it effectively disappears or it's so different that it's credentials to be genuine philosophy will always be in question and so it's phenon Is straddling that line of this idea of a superiority being something that is nothing but kind of experiences of hierarchy and privilege and so the reproduction of of that which is not Western is framed as backwards as uncivilized as lacking the tradition lacking the enlightenment Canon lacking the reason of the West um and so this is traditionally why we've uh this is in freaking zootopia why we frame the difference between those who are um those who are reasonable as civilized those who choose non-reason so they've exposed to reason are um barbarians because they've been presented with reason and chose the wrong way and then those that out are outside of reason and non-reason are savagery nature um out just a kind of violent natural world the original synthesis that it's it's out there and it's the consequence so you either get to be civilized or non-civilized or you get to be Savage these are categories of thought by which for example then the settlement I just know this better in the settlement of of federal colonialism here we we have the idea of terranolus so we have the idea that the Clone the colonial experience of North America is we encounter people's um but we say that they lack the capacity to have their systems that we see as valid and therefore this is Terra nullus it's still embedded in in our legal premise today is that the foundation of sovereign authority over Canada comes from the idea that there was no Sovereign Authority here because it didn't have the reason to be not just different because clearly the British and the French had different and the Spanish had different traditions which they fought about who was most reasonable but then used that to say ours is better than theirs and therefore ours is legitimate which is just a complete product of the use of force right that's what it is and so um there's three assumptions that come from this um one the one the West provides a singular model to be emulated we have very little historical evidence that it functions in a way that's not deeply cultural second the causes of underdevelopment are rooted in the traditional culture and institutions of the non-west so this is a discounting of the experiences of colonialism that result in the encounter in the first place and then that the non-west must abandon its traditions and adopt Western practices so this this is um the very concept of development versus Improvement as I insist over and over again whenever somebody says development just do the little switch in your mind of improvement because Improvement means that you know better right you simply know better um and so this this natural teleological assumption teleology just the idea that there's a logical normal progression that it functions in a one way that it's a linear path towards progress is still how we think about development to this day when we say development that's what we mean we mean that these these communities have to follow our systems if they want to get this and so um Spivak when she's talking about the subaltern she's talking about okay what happens if the in these experiences there's already forms of marginalization in the communities that are experienced colonialism what happens when those communities then replicate that on other communities so much so that they were already marginalized before the Colonial counter and now the colonized and the colonizer are caught in a struggle and there's groups that aren't even that for the colonized we're not participating in the process so how do we think about those and so this is her talking a bit about this subaltern and I've told this before so it's nothing private the story was that in 81 I was asked to write as a specialist under construction by Yale French studies and also by critical inquiry imagine how the times have changed but at that point for some reason I thought and I don't know the reason I wouldn't think so this way now I thought how is it that I have just become a specialist in French Theory and then I turned to my own class was my grandmother's sister yeah and I never wrote that in Canada speak because I knew that you know I I'm a theoretical person I knew that if I said so then I would get a lot of enthusiasm from from my reader saying oh isn't that you speak wonderful but her grandmother sister and so on so I never also my mother was a bit worried about this my mother said you're going to use a name I said ma you'll see nobody will pay any attention to it and as how he went and knows and he's filing away I got many many many many many hostile and negative responses as having silenced the subaltern except for one in the pages of socialist review Candice have Alton vote which was a wonderful piece coming from Nicaragua but anyway so therefore I did not mention it but I turned to my own class the Bengali middle class so on the one hand and on the other hand absolutely the class from which I came from French Theory that's all I could do but I did not remain there the the problems that emerged out of Canada speak were a the problem of subject chip and agency and B the call to build infrastructure in the colloquial not the Marxist sense so that agency would emerge see I saw this woman see also in that essay that essay has even been read and I've heard Drew Cornell say this in public as Gayatri vaccine this will connect to the accusation for feeding religious nationalism I don't know if I will be able to come to a proper end where I can say that mirananda's a sort of absurd book suggests that the Hindu right is reading guide to Spivak and as I said to sudipta here Terry Eagleton can't understand but the Hindu right not only is reading Gayatri but understanding her so that they can actually you know do Vedic science she's going fast here there's a lot in there but it's it's freaking hilarious um so she's first saying that she had to kind of remove her her Aunt both for fear of her aunt's name getting out there her great aunt I guess from her mother's sister um in order for can the subalterns seek to speak to be legible then she's saying that she didn't expect it to get this focus and it did it got backlash and it did There's Western Scholars who say they can't read it um and yet she's saying Hindu nationalism reads it so it becomes a source of political mobilization right so all of these different interpretations but they still kind of follow this dividing line about how the text is read both politically academically who can read it what she can include in it what she can't include it I'll let it go a bit because this is hilarious there are no footnotes ever given by Mr s particular context I have heard people say that I propose Sati as resistance against the British I think anybody who actually has read the piece will see that I say again and again that the abolition of Sati was an unquestioned good the piece is as critical of the Hindus as it is it is really not critical of the British reform all that it is trying to say is that the the since subject formation was not women's subject formation was not touched by this reform it could not last and this particular particular conviction is with me still okay and so just think of this in a simple form that you guys is intersectionality is that even though the the um the the end of the colonial experience and the nationalism that comes out as a rejection of the colonial experience in India it still doesn't touch the intersectional woman's experience of both the patriarching and colonization menstruation was against protesting against contemporary gendering by waiting for menstruation was in some ways also moving against Sati because remember satiq had to menstruation was a dirty secret you could not become a Sati if you were menstruating Etc and this woman who was living the problem with pacifism that we live today between ethics and politics in the situation of Palestine we would like I would like to be a pacifist Israel doesn't allow me to be that and to an extent palestine's response I'll keep you injected this over and over again okay I'm going to stop it there just because again I don't have I haven't set this up yet we'll get to this later um I will say there that menstruation will come back again I have a uh I think it's an article from The Hamilton Spectator in 2020 where a counselor in Hamilton Ontario insisted that menstruation was not something that should be spoken about in politics that it does not it is literally the foundation of of human propagation and yet we're not allowed to talk about it in political forums because it's a personal matter and so she's bringing it up here we don't need to get into it but the idea of this long history of cleanliness about how it it then marginalizes what you're allowed to do in public it also is a marker of reproductive capabilities and and then it reproduces kind of gender Norms in ways we could think about it anyways that was just her talking about the sub-altern as a way for us to to see how loaded some of these concepts are and how little we think about them um and I would say the textbook really is is so superficial with this we don't get into the kind of the deep interesting questions that come from these types of discussions
