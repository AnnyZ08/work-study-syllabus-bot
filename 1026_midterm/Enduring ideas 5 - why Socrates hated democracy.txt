 so this is the video from the text and it it links to what I just talked about in terms of this kind of logical progression or why democracy was was denigrated In classical political thought and why we have this tension with democracy especially from Elites right uh hatred of democracy we're used to thinking very highly of democracy and by extension of ancient Athens the civilization that gave rise to it the Parthenon has become almost a byword for Democratic Values which is why so many leaders of democracies like to be photographed there it's therefore very striking to discover that one of ancient Greece's greatest achievements philosophy was highly suspicious of its other achievement democracy the founding father of Greek philosophy Socrates is portrayed in the dialogues of Plato as hugely pessimistic about the whole business of democracy in book six of the Republic Plato describes Socrates falling into conversation with a character called adamantus and trying to get him to see the flaws of democracy by comparing a society to a ship if you were heading out on a journey by sea ask Socrates who would you ideally want deciding who was in charge of the vessel so let's be clear these thought exercises always go back to closed systems because closed systems are the only way to do science right to have boundaries on what we can understand and so we love closed system models or states of nature well-bounded thought experiments so that we can then articulate a claim of something that is a historical in order to reinforce our point just anyone or people educated in the rules and demands of seafaring the latter of course this is adamantus so why then respond Socrates do we keep thinking that any old person should be fit to judge who should be the ruler of a country socrates's point is that voting in an election is a skill not a random intuition and like any skill it needs to be taught systematically to people letting the citizenry vote without an education so okay let's be clear though this is a teacher saying that we need to have teachers in order to understand these things you don't traditionally have teachers in the trades and you learn those skills from others that aren't taught per se it's a practicum right like you learn by going on ships and learning from other people who have different roles and Authority a ship doesn't have a teacher on it and so this is this problem we have to be suspicious of the assumptions that are built into these models is it irresponsible as putting them in charge of a trirem sailing to Samos in a storm Socrates was to have first-hand catastrophic experience the foolishness of Voters in 399 BC the philosopher was put on trial on trump top charges of corrupting the Youth of Athens a jury of 500 Athenians was invited to weigh up the case and decided by a narrow margin that the philosopher was guilty he was put to death by Hemlock in a process which is for thinking people every bit as tragic as Jesus's condemnation whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay uh all right I guess we're doing the teachers are just another source of authority that we should Revere like religious Authority okay uh all right I haven't seen this video yet all right let's let's do that it's been for Christians crucially Socrates was not elitist in the normal sense he didn't believe that a narrow few should only ever vote he did however insist that only those who had thought about his shoes rationally and deeply should be let near a vote there's so many things to unpack here um um I would just say no um what level of education is necessary to know what politics are um and why again why is voting equivalent to democracy I'm not clear democracy should be participation by the people you know I don't know what a trial of 500 people what that proves any more than trial of 12 or trial by a judge it's just one person inserting their Authority for a decision we have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by Birthright we have given the vote to all without connecting it I don't know what intellectual democracy means the whole point of us reading about Socrates is about disciplining our thought in a specific way in order to tell us how to think and I do think there are reasons to view that politically I'm not saying that we should execute Socrates I am saying that you can't have political power and authority and expect it not to extend to thinking about thinking about education about the assumptions that we make into these structures this is a weird weird video to wisdom and Socrates knew exactly where that would lead to a system the Greeks feared above all demagoguery ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues for example the luge figure of alcibiotes a rich charismatic smooth talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military oh my God Elon no interest in Sicily Socrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers he asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner the sweet shop owner would say of his rival look this person here has worked many evils on you he hurts you gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like he'll never serve you feasts of many and varied Pleasant things like I will Socrates asked us to consider the audience's response do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively the true answer wow um yeah yeah there's always going to be scammers out there and there's always going to people be running graphs the question is is the grift one that is authorized by the state or not and how should we think about those things yes I mean doing what's in the public interest will often override the individual interest but sometimes the individual interests could be different especially when the public is a majoritarian public I I I'm more ambivalent about this than than this video seems to frame it I cause you trouble and go against your desires in order to help you would cause an uproar among the voters don't you think we have forgotten all about Yes except we have the long history of just like the assumptions of Western modernity put into medicine which eliminate Alternative forms of healing and knowledge and also say that only those with our authorized forms of authority have the best way to do things so we end up with things like diagnosing hysteria in women who are forced to stay at home all day and not do anything and participate in society because of patriarchy so I just we need to contest these ideas that we need to about Socrates is Salient warnings against democracy we have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good rather than as something that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it no I'm pretty sure social media has taught us that democracy is inherently dangerous I think we're good with that at this point we know that like everybody having a voice and participating the system can lead to weird outcomes as a result we have elected many sweet shop owners and very few doctors I'm better to rule you because I've studied politics more I I don't know it's weird these are just some of the extra discussion questions that we will probably talk about or that we can talk about in forums in these are the key terms I think I covered them all in the lecture turning the majority stated nature Sovereign rationalist rational ideas polity frenesis in the text Leviathan impunity ethics yep yeah I think we prepare for those all so um yeah that's the video I mean take it for what you will that like I said you know textbooks convey information it's not always great
