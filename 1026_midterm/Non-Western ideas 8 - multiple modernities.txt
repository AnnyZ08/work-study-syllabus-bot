 so to link this idea of kind of multiple histories or different histories or ideas as contextual and contingent is also this way in which we have to think about if we have never been modern I'll show later in a second then that what that that means is that there are specific moments that we culturally designate as importance so let's say Chachi PT emerges as a moment that we say is important that will inevitably be deployed in a whole bunch of different ways it will reflect power and interest but it'll never be deployed uniformly so the idea of having a uniform modernity that breaks with that which is pre-modern and talk about post-modern all that stuff just doesn't hold and so the idea then is about envisioning envisage and visiting uh new and alternate ways of organizing societies the easiest one for me is the way in which um Tanashi Coates has been working on developing the kind of the the specific history of like redlining and racial oppression and the legacy of slavery and decolonization reparations in the U.S works on the Black Panther comic book and then comes in and helps write the Black Panther movie which is envisioning a way in which you can use technology and African experience to propose a utopian ideal now it's still a monarchy and there's problems with it blah blah blah blah but the idea here is that we're envisioned envisaging both a cultural and modern form of an alternative world outside the defining of everything through a western Colonial experience doesn't mean colonialism doesn't exist doesn't mean those legacies don't impact how we think about those things it just means that the African modernity this kind of afropolitanism provides a perspective on not only decolonized but post-colonial ways of thinking about Western modern of individualism and sovereignty through specific experiences and different articulations about how we should do things and so we shouldn't like blindly Embrace European models of capitalism sovereignty and self-determination just primarily on the the basis that they don't even function like that right because they are embedded in cultural Frameworks when we try to transport models of development elsewhere like this is I'll give you banal examples from Canada over and over again American companies try to come in and try to operate in Canada and don't understand the cultural context so Target for example put had tons of research I think they put 20 billion in to resources set up all the stores transferred Zeller stores over to those um and then within a year was like yeah this isn't working at all we got to leave right I think sax is on the way out too um the cultural difference even between Canada and the US which let's be clear there's very little cultural difference at all in terms of kind of dominant cultural ideas and norms still doesn't mean that just because a business works one place will work elsewhere which is to say development won't work one place that works elsewhere it has to go through these cultural forms and this idea that we can develop an abstract ideal of this it just doesn't make any sense and so I couldn't find a great clip of litter talking about modernity but he is talking about how we have to think about the ways in which the deployment of science and technology is always going to be deployed through cultural forms and how we could still be Democratic I mean all of that had to be invented but the work which has been done for two centuries at least if we start with the beginning of a 18th century to invent the characters playing in democracy the notion of Citizen the notion of people the notion of social questions the notion of class is an invention of many many different different people in which the novelists as as important and statisticians and geographers and of course political uh inventors and political philosophers so what he's saying is there's a convergence of things that happen that are very contingent to those points of time remember I was talking about the novel right in the production of ideas the production of a shared ideas that that generates a nationalism so that's a material thing that has to exist in order for the next thing to happen and so there's all sorts of ways in which all of these contingent events take place in order to converge at certain moments in time where things succeed and other things fail so the problem of all these questions of ecology is that they find their way into politics matric too fast and there is so little work being done to absorb all of those new entities coming in I mean who could have imagined that most of political question would be linked to The Climate 40 years ago no but so there's been a bunch of arguments about this but the basically political science in the way that it's framed resources that we've talked about throughout has fundamentally sovereignty doesn't say anything about its ecological impact um and so there's been a couple arguments I think it was an Australian journal and political science that that in relationship to global climate change political science is fundamentally useless um because it never conceived of these questions in the first place and that's not true per se um the unfccc reports are clearly and if you try to read them they're impossible some some of them are like thousands of pages and you go through and what it's doing is documenting the science that then political actors can utilize to try to develop a political consensus but we're doing this very quickly and very very in a very short period we didn't substantively engage with these ideas early enough in the conceptualization of how we were thinking and so modernity has an ecological problem in part because political science didn't think ecologically until far too late but that's not enough it's not enough for us to think about it now we then have to go through the process of mediating this with the public about what the political choices are plastic bags straws these type of debates that take a long time to generate enough political consensus to result in the resources that result in systemic change and we're not sure that that's quick enough so now absolutely everybody's focused on it and we'll deal with this I think in the week 11. but the idea here is is that the modern ideas of what it was to be a you know an improve approved developed nation state weren't thinking these Concepts and ideas quickly enough because culturally and in in I mean nothing other than culturally we hadn't thought about these things where let's be clear lots of other societies had and so the reading of a specific way of dealing with these things creates a problem of not thinking multiple modernities so it is not exactly nobody a few people but so we we completely underestimate the difficulty of bringing ecology ecological question again I use ecology but it's not the right word a question of survival and living together um we underestimate the speed at which they need to be uh domesticated so to speak so to speak unmade politically relevant okay so yeah I agree so that's the the reason for the multiple attorneys I'll deal with um the questions of this in the next video
