 so I had no idea if I'll get a copyright strike for this or not so I can show this in class if um this doesn't work uh I might have to link to this as a um Dropbox link if uh this doesn't work but this is I mean this is in 2012. this this is the critique of democracy articulated very clearly um in both what has emerged as contemporary forms of democracy and then why those people would pick other Frameworks and structures amazing turn of events Tamir my fraud is being taken away this is nothing but a license for oil companies and foreign interests to destroy my beloved IA will remain a dictatorship [Music] where are you guys so anti dictators imagine if America was a dictatorship you could let one percent of the people have all the nation's wealth you could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes and bailing them out when they Gamble and lose you could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education your media would appear free but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family okay so that's the anti-Semitism in it so that isn't the APT version but again he's doing that intentionally but um otherwise you see all the parallels here right of all of these ideas that the dictatorship isn't here I mean famously the Marxist always saw the dictatorship of the proletariat right they wanted a dictatorship they just wanted it run by they actually didn't want democracy they wanted the people running the show and that's how you got communism not necessarily better but dictatorship as the imposition against these ideas you could lie about why you go to war you could fill your presence with one particular racial group and no one would complain you could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests I know this is hard for you Americans to imagine but please try I will tell you what democracy is democracy is the worst and the stalking and listening to every stupid opinion and everybody's vote counts no matter how crippled or black or female oh Jesus I didn't know he's doing that I don't care about this love scene uh it's interesting when I saw this on Instagram uh the first comment um was that uh he's clearly describing China sure he's clearly describing Russia sure so this is that back to the system approach that some people will see what they want to see out of these politics and some people will recognize these problems as exogenous to Liberal democracy because liberal democracy is the goal and these problems aren't liberal democracy's fault and so therefore they don't have anything to do with democracy itself um I'm suspicious of that claim
