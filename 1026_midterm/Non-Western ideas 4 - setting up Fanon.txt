 so this again is from the um yes we can reading but it's the idea that um classification is a key part of the way that reason structures and prayer times I mean the West like top 10 list top five lists you know Sports debates whatever we love lists because it's a classification system that lets us argue about things but the ways in which these classification systems work is the classifications are not neutral they're embedded with values and ideas as I talked about last week those ways in which we can do it the idea the institutions being located in specific places their languages and categories of thought derived from Greek and Latin Greek and Latin is a very specific foregrounding we've done it in this text foregrounding of which histories count which ones we'll listen to and which ones will repeat to students over and over again and so this idea of you know Italian Spanish and Portuguese dominant during the Renaissance German English and French dominant since the enlightenment are then reflected in the ways in which we have official languages at the United Nations so the idea here is that we we need to understand it's not just and I mean he was doing literary criticism and and and criticism but um there are other ways of kind of engaged thinking phenon is an example of an Engaged thinker who is experiencing this as well as thinking about it at the same time so um he wanted to examine not just how those stereotypes function as ways of structuring thought but the ways they become internalized right very specifically he's looking at the experiences of uh Colonial peoples I've got a video that of talking about this as well but about um his experience as engaging in in Warfare and then being told that even as a soldier who fights on the side where you're still different distinct from and so he's concerned with Algeria as a side of focus of of French colonialism but then what that French colonialism does to the people who experience it um and the ways in which this becomes internalized so these stereotypes become internalized by Colonial peoples and this is the oppressor and all of us stuff the ways in which we reproduce power and privilege um even if we're fighting Power and privilege which is is what he's doing so the internalization of norms excuse me on the sense of self and so this is why the anti-normativity stuff from last week I think I think is important to think about because if if we're just thinking about which Norms count we're just basically deciding which systems we want to have inside us inside and the ways that we do things so hopefully this will work the best kind of summary with some footage that I could find on this is from Al Jazeera which is interesting but it's in French which is also interesting so let's make sure the subtitles work um so here I'll try to make sure they work uh they might not I might have to pause this for a second and come back um um that's see here if I go full screen and there we go nope okay um
