 so the textbook talks about duselle as a way to critique similar to what it I showed with Kapoor the idea that the common experience of domination provides a foundation to rethink some of the assumptions of about how we think about participation who participates in where right that we can situate all sorts of different alliances if we're thinking about changing our attitudes that reflect the post-colonial experiences that are there already that are already always already there and so this idea of of examining the ways in which philosophy has been exported along with everything else is part of thinking about a more complex understanding because it's a better political analysis it just involves more ideas and and ways in which we think about things and so we'll have a little bit yeah conclusion is dijo is foreign is interesting how often Paris and France comes into foreign America Latina Association let's say that the insights here are simply that they're the combination of different relationships and authorities different sources of inspiration different ways of mobilizing the all of these Global local ideas coming together produce this this this outcome and so we see this in in all the readers this week in November the intellectual plural versity to achieve dollar decolonization the bomber that's provincialized Cosmopolitan which I'll show a video of in a second decenters Europe and aligning that with the ideas in which we live shariati this this Democratic socialism based on freedom social justice and and Civic spirituality and so provincializing Europe then is is this is just from 2020 during covet of um talking about this kind of situating the western experience what do you say impact on my my thinking one of the things I was trying to work out when I was working on provincial days in Europe was the relationship between thought and place I saw it in place I probably said so in the first chapter that that even when a thought aspires to speak for everybody but if the thought is improved then the very idiomatic city of that prose the original proves in which the thought is propounded the very idiomatic nature of human proofs makes sum of the parochial nature of the thought the place it comes from stick to the thought as it were parochial as in it it's from a specifically if you could if you could think and and as you know I mean if you read marks in German you do phenology if you read um you're so in French you become interested in the meaning of a word in the original language and what it means and you become interested in the problem of translation when you translate thought from one place to another and originalizing was deeply interested in the program of translation both with regard to the dialectic that Lisa was talking about and different models of translation so translation is a very interesting part about how these ideas have to be interpreted as they go through different mechanisms there's been lots of interesting recent feminist translation of texts all sorts of texts which when you just do it in a feminist frame much less all the other intersectional stuff we could add changes the meaning and understanding and situates it differently and so translation translation of ideas is important and the ways in which those ideas are translated and to treat ideas as non-translatable or that they haven't been translated is very much about ignoring the way in your in which eurocentricism is embedded in the ideas and that the place of of who gets to speak where and why and when right and who doesn't get to speak too and so the very idea of the nation-stage colonial Legacy that's led to aggression and violence and it remains in its wake we're in the wake of the structural violence and chauvinist nationalism that comes with it and so this idea then is that there is a hybridity of thought that takes place in provincial in in specific contextual place um that has things to say about global thought but we have to do the work and we have barely started the work in terms of doing this stuff uh the global performances with alternative modernities different ways to think about this back to Kapoor this articulation of the universal as contingent and the non-western world has already and continues to and never will not contribute to knowledge production and thinking over centuries it's just the extent to which we are willing to look at them and that this kind of this hybridity is is always there and they end on this this um poet scholar the idea at my place is placeness my traces choices I belong to the bluff so those who care will find well I can't do a better Poetic Justice it's a poem let the poem do the poem I'm not going to politicize the poll I'm out
